# The response of trophic interaction networks to multiple stressors in a marine latitudinal gradient of the Southern Hemisphere

## Abstract

1. Ecological networks are increasingly used as conceptual frameworks for understanding ecological community structure, identifying key species, and for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. Hence, there is a growing interest in understanding how ecological networks respond to environmental and anthropogenic stressors along geographical gradients.

2. We review for the first time the state-of-the-art knowledge on stressor responses of marine food webs along the southwest Atlantic to Antarctic gradient (45 - 78ÂºS), considering the following study areas: San Jorge Gulf, Beagle Channel, Burdwood Bank, Scotia Sea, Potter Cove (Antarctica) and Weddell Sea (Antarctica). The aim of this review is threefold: 1) describe the complexity and structure of marine food webs along the southwest Atlantic to Antarctic axis from a network perspective; 2) identify the ongoing environmental and anthropogenic stressors for each marine ecosystem containing the food webs; and 3) summarize reported  food web changes and develop hypotheses on how the identified stressors affect food web features.

3. Environmental and anthropogenic stressor effects in the study areas have been mostly assessed individually and at the node (species) level, with one exception: the effect of fisheries in the San Jorge Gulf food web. To address the most plausible stressors effects on the selected food webs, we built hypotheses for each study area considering the following: a) stressor(s), b) parameter(s) affected, c) node-level properties of the affected species, and d) network-level properties of the food web.

4. The most common stressor reported along the gradient is global warming, except for Beagle Channel and Burdwood Bank, which are more influenced by the introduction of an alien species and fisheries, respectively. We provide particular hypotheses on how warming might impact food webs.

5. We demonstrate the advantages of applying a network approach to better understand and predict the effect of stressors in marine ecosystems of the Southern Hemisphere.

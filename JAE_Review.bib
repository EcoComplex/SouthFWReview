  abstract = {Neritic fronts are very abundant in austral South America, covering several scales of space and time. However, this region is poorly studied from a systemic point of view. Our main goal is to develop a holistic view of physical and ecological patterns and processes at austral South America, regarding frontal arrangements. Satellite information (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration), and historical hydrographic data were employed to show fronts. We compiled all existing evidence (physical and biological) about fronts to identify regions defined by similar types of coastal fronts and to characterize them. Fronts in austral South America can be arranged in six zones according to their location, main forcing, key physical variables, seasonality, and enrichment mechanisms. Four zones, the Atlantic upwelling zone; the temperate estuarine zone; the Patagonian tidal zone and the Argentine shelf-break zone, occupy most of the Atlantic side. The Chile\textendash Peru upwelling zone, on the Pacific, is the largest and best-known region. The Patagonian cold estuarine zone encompasses the tip of South America, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and remains poorly studied. When observed at a continental scale, the Pacific coast dominated by two large frontal zones appears simplest than the Atlantic coast in terms of frontal richness. The extension of the continental shelf in the Atlantic coast allows for the development of a great diversity of mesoscale fronts. Though frontal zones we defined are extensive areas of the continental shelves, fronts inside the zones are comparatively small areas. Even so, they play a paramount role in ecological processes, allowing for high biological production; offering feeding and/or reproductive habitats for fishes, squids, and birds; acting as retention areas for larvae of benthic species; and promoting establishment of benthic invertebrates that benefit from the organic production in the frontal area.},

  abstract = {Investigations in recent years of the ecological structure and processes of the Southern Ocean have almost exclusively taken a bottom-up, forcing-by-physical-processes approach relating various species' population trends to climate change. Just 20 years ago, however, researchers focused on a broader set of hypotheses, in part formed around a paradigm positing interspecific interactions as central to structuring the ecosystem (forcing by biotic processes, top-down), and particularly on a ``krill surplus'' caused by the removal from the system of more than a million baleen whales. Since then, this latter idea has disappeared from favour with little debate. Moreover, it recently has been shown that concurrent with whaling there was a massive depletion of finfish in the Southern Ocean, a finding also ignored in deference to climate-related explanations of ecosystem change. We present two examples from the literature, one involving gelatinous organisms and the other involving penguins, in which climate has been used to explain species' population trends but which could better be explained by including species interactions in the modelling. We conclude by questioning the almost complete shift in paradigms that has occurred and discuss whether it is leading Southern Ocean marine ecological science in an instructive direction.},

The Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi has been the main demersal resource that supports a fishery since 1971. Given that M. hubbsi is a generalist and opportunistic predator, its diet from the perspective of specific composition and feeding strategy was evaluated. Fourteen species were identified belonging to four zoological groups (3 fishes, 4 molluscs, 6 crustaceans and 1 bryozoan). The most commonly consumed prey was the lobster krill Munida gregaria (index of relative importance -\%IRI- 72.19\%) followed by the white shrimp Peisos petrunkevitchi (\%IRI 19.04\%) and M. hubbsi (\%IRI 7.95\%). Most prey were infrequently consumed and at low abundances, which it is common for a generalist-opportunistic predator. Substantial changes in the diet composition were detected when compared to a previous study, showing a large increase in crustacean occurrence in concordance with the abundance changes observed in the environment. The results from this study highlighted the importance to consider information about population trends and trophic relationships to better understand the dynamics of marine communities under exploitation.},

While some exotic species are implicated in many species extinctions, others can provide benefits to the recipient communities. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to quantify and synthesize the ecological effects of 76 exotic marine species (about 6\% of the listed exotics) on ten variables in marine communities. These species caused an overall significant, but modest in magnitude (as indicated by a mean effect size of g\,{$<$}\,0.2), decrease in ecological variables. Marine primary producers and predators were the most disruptive trophic groups of the exotic species. Approximately 10\% (that is, 2 out of 19) of the exotic species assessed in at least three independent studies had significant impacts on native species. Separating the innocuous from the disruptive exotic species provides a basis for triage efforts to control the marine exotic species that have the most impact, thereby helping to meet Aichi Biodiversity Target 9 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.},

  abstract = {The climate around the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is rapidly changing and dramatically affecting marine coastal waters. Increases in air and seawater temperatures, not matter how small, can alter coastal biological communities due to both temperature increases as well as salinity reduction from glacier melting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the individual and combined effects of elevated sea surface temperature (+4 \textdegree C) and decreased salinity (-4) on growth and assemblage composition of natural summer phytoplankton from Potter Cove (King George Island, South Shetlands, northern WAP), using an outdoor microcosm experiment. Pigment composition was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/Chemtax) and species composition by light and electron microscopy. Increases in phytoplankton biomass during the first 3 days at elevated-temperatures coincided with an increase in the abundance and the specific growth rate of small centric diatoms (Chaetoceros socialis and Shionodiscus gaarderae, mostly observed in temperate waters) and unidentified small phytoflagellates {$<$} 5 {$\mu$}m. In contrast, pennate diatoms significantly decreased. At the end of the experiment on day 7, under nitrate and phosphate limitation, chlorophytes abundances increased under low salinity whereas prasinophytes decreased in all treatments. This study suggests that climate change could notably affect Antarctic phytoplankton composition by favouring temperate-water species previously undetected in Antarctic waters, such us S. gaarderae. Moreover, the observed changes in phytoplankton structure, associated with an increase of nano- over micro-size taxa, could have important implications for future Antarctic food webs.},

Their density distributions1,3,4,6 have been described in the period 1926\textendash 51, while recent localized studies7,8,9,10 suggest short-term changes. To examine spatial and temporal changes over larger scales, we have combined all available scientific net sampling data from 1926 to 2003. This database shows that the productive southwest Atlantic sector contains {$>$}50\% of Southern Ocean krill stocks, but here their density has declined since the 1970s. Spatially, within their habitat, summer krill density correlates positively with chlorophyll concentrations. Temporally, within the southwest Atlantic, summer krill densities correlate positively with sea-ice extent the previous winter. Summer food and the extent of winter sea ice are thus key factors in the high krill densities observed in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Krill need the summer phytoplankton blooms of this sector, where winters of extensive sea ice mean plentiful winter food from ice algae, promoting larval recruitment7,8,9,10,11 and replenishing the stock. Salps, by contrast, occupy the extensive lower-productivity regions of the Southern Ocean and tolerate warmer water than krill2,3,4,12. As krill densities decreased last century, salps appear to have increased in the southern part of their range. These changes have had profound effects within the Southern Ocean food web10,13.},

Polar species may be sensitive to warming and ice loss, but data are scarce and evidence is conflicting2\textendash 4. Here, we show that, within their main population centre in the southwest Atlantic sector, the distribution of Euphausia superba (hereafter, `krill') has contracted southward over the past 90\,years. Near their northern limit, numerical densities have declined sharply and the population has become more concentrated towards the Antarctic shelves. A concomitant increase in mean body length reflects reduced recruitment of juvenile krill. We found evidence for environmental controls on recruitment, including a reduced density of juveniles following positive anomalies of the Southern Annular Mode. Such anomalies are associated with warm, windy and cloudy weather and reduced sea ice, all of which may hinder egg production and the survival of larval krill5. However, the total post-larval density has declined less steeply than the density of recruits, suggesting that survival rates of older krill have increased. The changing distribution is already perturbing the krill-centred food web6 and may affect biogeochemical cycling7,8. Rapid climate change, with associated nonlinear adjustments in the roles of keystone species, poses challenges for the management of valuable polar ecosystems3.},

  abstract = {Aim The network structure of food webs plays an important role in the maintenance of diversity and ecosystem functioning in ecological communities. Previous research has found that ecosystem size, resource availability, assembly history and biotic interactions can potentially drive food web structure. However, the relative influence of climatic variables that drive broad-scale biogeographic patterns of species richness and composition has not been explored for food web structure. In this study, we assess the influence of broad-scale climatic variables in addition to known drivers of food web structure on replicate observations of a single aquatic food web, sampled from the leaves of the pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), at different geographic sites across a broad latitudinal and climatic range. Location Using standardized sampling methods, we conducted an extensive `snapshot' survey of 780 replicated aquatic food webs collected from the leaves of the pitcher plant S. purpurea at 39 sites from northern Florida to Newfoundland and westward to eastern British Columbia. Methods We examined correlations of 15 measures of food web structure at the pitcher and site scales with geographic variation in temperature and precipitation, concentrations of nutrients from atmospheric nitrogen deposition, resource availability, ecosystem size and the abundance of the pitcher plant mosquito (Wyeomyia smithii), a potential keystone species. Results At the scale of a single pitcher plant leaf, linkage density, species richness, measures of chain length and the proportion of omnivores in a web all increased with pitcher volume. Linkage density and species richness were greater at high-latitude sites, which experience low mean temperatures and precipitation and high annual variation in both of these variables. At the site scale, variation in 8 of the 15 food web metrics decreased at higher latitudes, and variation in measures of chain length increased with the abundance of mosquitoes. Main conclusions Ecosystem size and climatic variables related to latitude were most strongly correlated with network structure of the Sarracenia food web. However, in spite of large sample sizes, thorough standardized sampling and the large geographic extent of the survey, even the best-fitting models explained less than 40\% of the variation in food web structure. In contrast to biogeographic patterns of species richness, food web structure was largely independent of broad-scale climatic variables. The large proportion of unexplained variance in our analyses suggests that stochastic assembly may be an important determinant of local food web structure.},

  abstract = {The fauna of the Argentine (SW Atlantic Ocean) shelf allows to distinguish two biogeographic provinces: the Argentine and the Magellanic that are part of the Subtropical and Subantarctic Regions. The former extends from 30\textdegree{} S-32\textdegree{} S to 41\textdegree{} S-44\textdegree{} S and from the coast to the 82-95 m isobath, between 35\textdegree{} S-39\textdegree{} S, to 70 m depth in the north Patagonia. The latter extends from the Vald\'es Peninsula to the southern extreme and from 43\textdegree{} S northward, east area of the Argentine Province. The different physiographic characteristics allow to distinguish movable sandy bottoms in the Argentine Province and in the Magellanic gravel bottoms where large algae grow. The climatic differences explain the prevalence of northern winds in the first, where warm and temperate-cold coastal waters alternate and western strong winds in the second with net predominance of subantarctic waters from the Malvinas Current. The factors mentioned explain the differences in the faunal composition of both Provinces; the Argentina is characterized by a marked heterogeneity of its components and the Magellanic by its homogeneity and own taxa. The detailed analysis of the faunal composition of both Provinces performed using benthonic organisms (echinoderms, crustaceans and molluscs) and nektonic (fishes) resulted in subdivisions that correspond to the Uruguayan District, down to 38\textdegree{} S-39\textdegree{} S and the Rionegrin, south of said latitude in the Argentine Province and the Chubutian and Southpatagonic, north and south of 47\textdegree{} S in the Magellanic. The hydrographic regime allowed to establish the Santacrucean and Fuegian Subdistricts within the Southpatagonic District, which supports the warm drift theory in the Uruguayan and Rionegrin Districts of the Argentine Province and in the Chubutian of the Magellanic. The feature that characterizes the Southpatagonic District is the absence of a warm water tongue.},

  abstract = {The productivity and linkages in the food web of the southern region of the west Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf were investigated using a multi-trophic level mass balance model. Data collected during the Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics field program were combined with data from the literature on the abundance and diet composition of zooplankton, fish, seabirds and marine mammals to calculate energy flows in the food web and to infer the overall food web structure at the annual level. Sensitivity analyses investigated the effects of variability in growth and biomass of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and in the biomass of Antarctic krill predators on the structure and energy fluxes in the food web. Scenario simulations provided insights into the potential responses of the food web to a reduced contribution of large phytoplankton (diatom) production to total primary production, and to reduced consumption of primary production by Antarctic krill and mesozooplankton coincident with increased consumption by microzooplankton and salps. Model-derived estimates of primary production were 187\textendash 207gCm-2y-1, which are consistent with observed values (47\textendash 351gCm-2y-1). Simulations showed that Antarctic krill provide the majority of energy needed to sustain seabird and marine mammal production, thereby exerting a bottom-up control on higher trophic level predators. Energy transfer to top predators via mesozooplanton was a less efficient pathway, and salps were a production loss pathway because little of the primary production they consumed was passed to higher trophic levels. Increased predominance of small phytoplankton (nanoflagellates and cryptophytes) reduced the production of Antarctic krill and of its predators, including seabirds and seals.},

  abstract = {Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are the most remote regions on Earth, and their quite pristine environmental conditions are increasingly threatened by local scientific, tourism and fishing activities and long-range transport of persistent anthropogenic contaminants from lower latitudes. Plastic debris has become one of the most pervasive and ubiquitous synthetic wastes in the global environment, and even at some coastal Antarctic sites it is the most common and enduring evidence of past and recent human activities. Despite the growing scientific interest in the occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in the Antarctic environment, the lack of standardized methodologies for the collection, analysis and assessment of sample contamination in the field and in the lab does not allow us to establish their bioavailability and potential impact. Overall, most of the Southern Ocean appears to be little-affected by plastic contamination, with the exception of some coastal marine ecosystems impacted by wastewater from scientific stations and tourist vessels or by local fishing activities. Microplastics have been detected in sediments, benthic organisms, Antarctic krill and fish, but there is no clear evidence of their transfer to seabirds and marine mammals. Therefore, we suggest directing future research towards standardization of methodologies, focusing attention on nanoplastics (which probably represent the greatest biological risks) and considering the interactions of MPs with macro- and microalgae (especially sea-ice algae) and the formation of epiplastic communities. In coastal ecosystems directly impacted by human activities, the combined exposure to paint chips, metals, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), contaminants of emerging interest (CEI) and pathogenic microorganisms represents a potential danger for marine organisms. Moreover, the Southern Ocean is very sensitive to water acidification and has shown a remarkable decrease in sea-ice formation in recent years. These climate-related stresses could reduce the resilience of Antarctic marine organisms, increasing the impact of anthropogenic contaminants and pathogenic microorganisms.},

A realistic consensus view must be achieved as soon as possible. Having been very cool and constant for several million years, polar hotspots such as the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) are now rapidly warming. The current rate of CO2 increase and, with a lag phase, temperature, is unparalleled\textemdash maybe for 10s of millions of years. Experimental evidence suggests the shallow mega- and macrobenthos is very sensitive to temperature change (stenothermal). Being warmed to about 10\textdegree C kills most species tested to date but even smaller experimental rises (just 2 or 3\textdegree C above normal) drastically hinders their ability to perform critical functions, such as predator avoidance behaviour. In contrast, new evidence of bathymetric and geographic distributions shows species ranges encompass localities with varying and warmer temperatures such as the intertidal zone or the shelf of South Georgia. This suggests, at the species level, an unexpected ability to live in areas with significantly different and raised temperature regimes. Scientists have focused on potential responses of a few species in a few areas. However, these are often atypical of fauna on the whole. Distribution assessments suffer from not knowing the capacity differences between populations and how fast they arise. To begin meaningful estimates of how shelf mega- and macrobenthos will respond to rapid warming, where and at what should we be looking? The AP continental shelf is probably amongst the most sensitive. A more widespread evaluation of the capabilities of different species and across life-history cycles is needed. We need to compare differences between communities in the more temperature-variable and -stable sites to predict ecological scale responses to future changes.},

  abstract = {The role of fish in the Antarctic food web in inshore and offshore waters is analysed, taking as an example the coastal marine communities of the southern Scotia Arc (South Orkney Islands and South Shetland Islands) and the west Antarctic Peninsula. Inshore, the ecological role of demersal fish is more important than that of krill. There, demersal fish are major consumers of benthos and also feed on zooplankton (mainly krill in summer). They are links between lower and upper levels of the food web and are common prey of other fish, birds and seals. Offshore, demersal fish depend less on benthos and feed more on zooplankton (mainly krill) and nekton, and are less accessible as prey of birds and seals. There, pelagic fish (especially lantern fish) are more abundant than inshore and play an important role in the energy flow from macrozooplankton to higher trophic levels (seabirds and seals). Through the higher fish predators, energy is transferred to land in the form of fish remains, pellets (birds), regurgitation and faeces (birds and seals). However, in the general context of the Antarctic marine ecosystem, krill (Euphausia superba) plays the central role in the food web because it is the main food source in terms of biomass for most of the high level predators from demersal fish up to whales. This has no obvious equivalent in other marine ecosystems. In Antarctic offshore coastal and oceanic waters the greatest proportion of energy from the ecosystem is transferred to land directly through krill consumers, such as flying birds, penguins, and seals. Beside krill, the populations of fish in the Antarctic Ocean are the second most important element for higher predators, in particular the energy-rich pelagic Myctophidae in open waters and the pelagic Antarctic silver fish (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the high Antarctic zone. Although the occurrence of these pelagic fish inshore has been poorly documented, their abundance in neritic waters could be higher than previously believed.},

The methodology included a comparative analysis of benthic organisms identified in the stomachs and those collected on macroalgal beds (Ivlev Index). Benthic amphipods, mainly Gondogeneia antarctica and Cheirimedon femoratus, followed by macroalgae, mainly Palmaria decipiens and Desmarestia spp., were the most important and frequent dietary items (IRI\%) for both nototheniids. However, NOC was more herbivorous and fed more intensively on a wider diversity of benthic organisms such as certain algal-associated groups like gastropods and bivalves, whereas NOR fed on a greater proportion of epibenthic amphipods and other epibenthic prey. Although in the last three decades the physiognomy of the inner cove has been changed due to the~retreat of the Fourcade Glacier, at our sampling site in the outer cove the abundance and vertical distribution of macroalgae did not show substantial changes compared with those reported in the literature in 1994\textendash 1996. Temporal differences in the feeding selectivity of NOC on amphipod species, between contemporary and historical samples, may be explained by variations in the assemblage of the algal-associated epifauna. We suggest factors that may have produced these changes.},

Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize \textemdash{} or rewire \textemdash{} food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring \textemdash{} a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring \textemdash{} changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web's interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists' responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

Moreover, our results show that species and food-web dissimilarities are consistently correlated, but that much of the variation in food-web structure across spatial, environmental, and species gradients remains unexplained. Novel food-web assembly models demonstrate the importance of biotic filtering during community assembly by (1) the availability of resources and (2) limiting similarity in species' interactions to avoid strong niche overlap and thus competitive exclusion. This reveals a strong signature of biotic filtering processes during local community assembly, which constrains the variability in structural food-web patterns across local communities despite substantial turnover in species composition.},

The role of species interactions in propagating the effects of stressors, although widely acknowledged, has yet to be formally explored. Here, we conceptualise how stressors propagate through food webs and explore how they affect simulated three-species motifs and food webs of the Canadian St. Lawrence System. We find that overlooking species interactions invariably underestimate the effects of stressors, and that synergistic and antagonistic effects through food webs are prevalent. We also find that interaction type influences a species' susceptibility to stressors; species in omnivory and tri-trophic food chain interactions in particular are sensitive and prone to synergistic and antagonistic effects. Finally, we find that apex predators were negatively affected and mesopredators benefited from the effects of stressors due to their trophic position in the St. Lawrence System, but that species sensitivity is dependent on food web structure. In conceptualising the effects of multiple stressors on food webs, we bring theory closer to practice and show that considering the intricacies of ecological communities is key to assess the net effects of stressors on species.},

Ten research cruises were carried out each year during January from 2005 to 2014. A total of 18,461 specimens of Me. hubbsi was analysed, of which 6,777 (36.71\%) contained food in their stomachs.

Since many polar long-term data series are fragmented and cannot be analysed with common time series analysis tools, we present statistical approaches that can deal with missing values. We applied U-statistics after Pettit and Buishand to detect abrupt changes, dynamic factor analysis to detect functional relationships, and additive modelling to detect patterns in time related to climatic cycles such as the Southern Annular Mode and El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation in a long-term environmental data set from King George Island (WAP), covering 20 years. Our results not only reveal sudden changes for sea surface temperature and salinity, but also clear patterns in all investigated variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, suspended particulate matter and Chlorophyll a) that can directly be related to climatic cycles. Our results complement previous findings on climate related changes in the King George Island Region and provide insight into the environmental conditions and climatic drivers of system change in the study area. Hence, our statistical analyses may prove valuable for other polar environmental data sets and contribute to a better understanding of the regional variability of climate change and its impact on coastal systems.},

These stocks, exploited since 1996, currently support one of the most important scallop fisheries in the world. Here, we investigate whether those aggregations are spatially coincidental with major frontal systems. Several pieces of information were used: historical survey data documenting the geographic distribution of the Patagonian scallop beds, catch and effort data from the commercial fleet, oceanographic data on frontal systems, and remote sensing imagery. We found that large-scale aggregations do match the location of three major and very different frontal systems in the southwestern Atlantic: the Shelf-Break Frontal System, the Northern Patagonia Frontal System, and the Southern Patagonia Frontal System. We describe the three frontal systems and their associated scallops fishing grounds and discuss which processes can contribute to sustaining the productivity of the scallop grounds in each case.},

So far, global modelling studies have focused largely on how alteration of individual properties will affect marine life. Here, we use global modelling simulations in conjunction with rotated factor analysis to express model projections in terms of regional trends in concomitant changes to biologically influential multi-stressors. Factor analysis demonstrates that regionally distinct patterns of complex oceanic change are evident globally. Preliminary regional assessments using published evidence of phytoplankton responses to complex change reveal a wide range of future responses to interactive multi-stressors with {$<$}20\textendash 300\% shifts in phytoplankton physiological rates, and many unexplored potential interactions. In a future ocean, provinces will encounter different permutations of change that will probably alter the dominance of key phytoplankton groups and modify regional productivity, ecosystem structure and biogeochemistry.

With little glacial melt disturbance (during cold El Ni\~no spring 2015), clear waters enabled high benthic microalgal production, resulting in net autotrophic benthic communities. In contrast, water column turbidity caused by increased glacial melt run-off (summer 2015 and warm La Ni\~na spring 2016) limited benthic microalgal production and turned the benthic communities net heterotrophic. Ongoing accelerations in glacial melt and run-off may steer shallow Antarctic seafloor ecosystems towards net heterotrophy, altering the metabolic balance of benthic communities and potentially impacting the carbon balance and food webs at the Antarctic seafloor.},

Krill abundance fluctuates with oceanographic conditions, most notably variation in winter sea ice, and is susceptible to environmental change. Although links between local krill availability and performance of land breeding, central place foragers are recognised, the effects of krill variability on baleen whales remain largely unclear because concurrent long-term data on whale condition and krill abundance do not exist. Here, we quantify links between whale body condition and krill abundance using a simple model that links krill abundance to sea ice extent. Body condition of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) caught in west Australian waters between 1947 and 1963 was estimated from oil yields in whaling records. Annual estimates of krill abundance in the Southern Ocean where those whales foraged (70\textdegree\textendash 130\textdegree E) were correlated significantly with contemporary annual winter sea ice extent. We hindcast sea ice extent for the whaling period from reconstructed temperature data and found that whale body condition was significantly correlated with hindcasted winter sea ice extent, supporting the hypothesis that variations in body condition were likely mediated by associated krill fluctuations. As humpback whales migrate and breed on finite energy stores accrued during summer foraging in the Antarctic, changes in sea ice and concomitant changes in krill abundance have long-term implications for their condition and reproductive success.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {Multiple stressors are increasingly affecting organisms and communities, thereby modifying ecosystems' state and functioning. Raising awareness about the threat from multiple stressors has increased the number of experimental and observational studies specifically addressing consequences of stressor interactions on biota. Most studies measure the direct effects of multiple stressors and their interactions on biological endpoints such as abundance, biomass, or diversity of target organisms. This yields invaluable information for the management and restoration of stressed ecosystems. However, as we argue in our perspective paper, this common approach ignores a fundamental characteristic of communities and ecosystems, i.e., that organisms in ecosystems are interlinked by biotic interactions in ecological networks. Examples from the literature show that biotic interactions can modify stressor effects, transfer stressor effects to distant groups of organisms, and create new stressor interactions. These examples also suggest that changes in biotic interactions can have effects of similar or greater magnitude than direct stressor effects. We provide a perspective on how to include network characteristics and biotic interactions into analyses of multiple-stressor effects on ecosystems. Our approach can also make use of biomonitoring data produced with established and intercalibrated methods, and can combine it with novel metrics used to describe the functioning of ecosystems, such as trait information or stable-isotope measurements. The insights on network-mediated effects gained via the approach we propose can substantially increase mechanistic understanding of multiple-stressor effects, and in turn, the efficiency of ecosystem management and restoration.},

Monthly samplings were conducted along the mid area of the Beagle Channel from March 2015 to February 2016, covering all seasons. Larval fish were present throughout the year, of which Patagonotothen spp. were dominant, particularly in spring. Bayesian stable isotope mixing models revealed that autochthonous carbon sources were more important for the particulate organic matter in surface (POM) and the particulate organic matter in sediment (SPOM) than allochthonous sources, which only slightly contributed to the POM. Also, seasonality in the contribution was observed. Microplankton was more important to the POM from the autochthonous carbon sources analysed, particularly in winter and spring. In addition, parts of the giant kelp M. pyrifera (blade, stipe and holdfast) equally contributed to the SPOM in all seasons. Microzooplankton organisms in the Beagle Channel depended on the POM and microplankton almost all the year, except in spring when SPOM gained relevance as a carbon source. Although fish larvae fed mainly on microzooplankton, a significant contribution of SPOM was also observed. Therefore, the giant kelp forests, in addition to providing refuge for fish larvae in the Beagle Channel, constitute an important carbon source for their planktonic prey during spring through the detrital pathway.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTThe Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill was the largest accidental release of crude oil into the sea in history, and represents the most extensive use of chemical dispersants to treat an oil spill. Following the spill, extensive studies were conducted to determine the potential acute and sublethal toxic effects of crude oil and dispersants on a range of planktonic, nektonic, and benthic marine organisms. Organisms such as phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish were examined via controlled laboratory studies, while others, such as deep-sea benthic invertebrates, which are difficult to sample, maintain, and study in the laboratory, were assessed through field studies. Laboratory studies with marine fishes focused on the sublethal effects of oil and dispersants, and early life history stages were generally found to be more sensitive to these toxins than adults. Field studies in the vicinity of the DWH spill indicate a significant reduction in abundance and diversity of benthic meiofauna and macrofauna as well as visual damage to deep-sea corals. Overall, studies indicate that while the responses of various marine species to oil and dispersants are quite variable, a general picture is emerging that chemical dispersants may be more toxic to some marine organisms than previously thought, and that small oil droplets created by dispersant use and directly consumed by marine organisms are often more toxic than crude oil alone.}

We performed two colonization experiments in the upper subtidal (3 and 5~m depth) using artificial substrates in Potter Cove (South Shetland Islands): in the outer cove, an area mainly unaffected by sedimentation, and in the inner cove, in close proximity to a retreating glacier, with high sediment inflow particularly during the melting season. Seasonal and interannual changes in total, diatom and macroalgal cover, species composition, and ecological indexes were assessed over four years. Tiles were analysed in spring and summer in the laboratory and by year-round photographic monitoring. Irradiance (photosynthetically active radiation and ultraviolet radiation), salinity, and temperature were monitored on a monthly basis. Benthic algae dominated the assemblages, with macroalgae reaching \textasciitilde 70\% cover after two years. There were site and temporal differences in the contribution of diatom mats (mainly pennate forms) and macroalgal cover. Diatom cover was higher at the glacier-influenced site, particularly at the early stages, and decreased significantly with time. Between years, macroalgal assemblages changed significantly in a site-specific manner. Assemblages mainly comprised annual and pseudoperennial species at both sites, with absence of adult large Desmarestiales. Although a year separated the establishment of the two experiments, there were convergence patterns in the changes of cover over time\textemdash that seemed to be controlled by competitive interactions\textemdash and in the patterns of species replacement. However, the inner cove site exhibited lower number of macroalgal taxa and a tendency to decreased diversity over time that could be related to higher level of stress and disturbance caused by glacial influence.},

In situ high-resolution cross-frontal measurements were collected using a remotely operated towed vehicle to characterize the three-dimensional structure of the tidal front and to investigate how its position varies during the semidiurnal tidal cycle (high/low) and the spring to neap transition, together with its impact on the distribution of nutrients and chlorophyll-a. Estimates of tidal height and flow velocity derived from a numerical model support the conclusion that frontal displacements mostly result from advection by cross-frontal tidal currents. The frontal position was also modified by baroclinic instabilities that significantly distort the front. Measurements reveal intrusions of low-salinity, nutrient-rich waters from the mixed side into the pycnocline on the stratified side cause a subsurface chlorophyll-a peak near the neap phase. Most prior studies of fronts in the SJG have been limited to their surface manifestations because they were conducted using satellite images. This article aims to contribute to the understanding of the complex southern tidal front dynamics, highlighting that maximum primary productivity occurs in a subsurface layer that is not visible by satellite sensors.}

However, little is known about the relative roles of ecological and biogeographical processes in determining how species interactions vary across space and time. Here, we study the spatiotemporal variation in predator\textendash prey interaction networks formed by anurans and arthropods and test for the effects of prey availability in determining interaction patterns, information that is often absent and limits the understanding of the determinants of network structure. We found that network dissimilarity between ecoregions and seasons was high and primarily driven by interaction rewiring. Interaction rewiring drove variation across seasons and ecoregions and species turnover was positively related to geographical distance. Using a null model approach to disentangle the effect of prey availability on the spatial and temporal variation we show that differences in prey availability were important in determining the variation in network structure between seasons and among areas. Our study reveals that fluctuations in prey abundance, along with limited dispersal abilities of anurans and their prey, may be responsible for the spatial patterns that emerged in our predator\textendash prey metaweb. These findings contribute to our understanding of the assembly rules that maintain biotic processes in metacommunities and highlight the importance of prey availability to the structure of these systems.},

A dual isotope mixing model was used to estimate diet proportions of adult salmonids (validated with stomach content analyses) and showed that chinook salmon (TL 4.9) and brown trout (TL 4.7) feed largely on sprats (96\% and 79\% predicted by the model) and were clustered together with intermediate size fish and cephalopod predators (TL 4.6\textendash 5), a diet similar to that in their native ranges (North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans). Adult anadromous rainbow trout clustered together with zooplanktivorous species (TL 3.2\textendash 4.4), and the model predicted a diet dominated by planktonic crustaceans (55\%), very different from the diet dominated by fish and squids characteristic of adult steelhead in the North Pacific Ocean. Diet predictions based on stable isotopes for Chinook salmon were indistinguishable from direct assessments of stomach contents of fish captured by bottom trawlers and overlapped widely with the diet of Magellanic penguins. The lack of reports on captures of anadromous rainbow trout by bottom trawlers suggests that this species has a shallower distribution. Stable isotope data for rainbow trout are very similar to those of rockhopper penguins, which feed on planktonic crustaceans, fish larvae, and juveniles.},

In estuarine, marine and terrestrial food webs there was no effect of latitude on any scaling relationship, suggesting constant niche breadth in these habitats.

  abstract = {Many different concepts have been used to describe species' roles in food webs (i.e., the ways in which species participate in their communities as consumers and resources). As each concept focuses on a different aspect of food-web structure, it can be difficult to relate these concepts to each other and to other aspects of ecology. Here we use the Eltonian niche as an overarching framework, within which we summarize several commonly-used role concepts (degree, trophic level, motif roles, and centrality). We focus mainly on the topological versions of these concepts but, where dynamical versions of a role concept exist, we acknowledge these as well. Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of ``gray areas'' between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species' niches (if any) they wish to address. The ecological meaning of differences between species' roles can change dramatically depending on which role concept(s) are used.},

  abstract = {Some ecosystems can undergo abrupt transformation in response to relatively small environmental change. Identifying imminent `tipping points' is crucial for biodiversity conservation, particularly in the face of climate change. Here, we describe a tipping point mechanism likely to induce widespread regime shifts in polar ecosystems. Seasonal snow and ice-cover periodically block sunlight reaching polar ecosystems, but the effect of this on annual light depends critically on the timing of cover within the annual solar cycle. At high latitudes, sunlight is strongly seasonal, and ice-free days around the summer solstice receive orders of magnitude more light than those in winter. Early melt that brings the date of ice-loss closer to midsummer will cause an exponential increase in the amount of sunlight reaching some ecosystems per year. This is likely to drive ecological tipping points in which primary producers (plants and algae) flourish and out-compete dark-adapted communities. We demonstrate this principle on Antarctic shallow seabed ecosystems, which our data suggest are sensitive to small changes in the timing of sea-ice loss. Algae respond to light thresholds that are easily exceeded by a slight reduction in sea-ice duration. Earlier sea-ice loss is likely to cause extensive regime shifts in which endemic shallow-water invertebrate communities are replaced by algae, reducing coastal biodiversity and fundamentally changing ecosystem functioning. Modeling shows that recent changes in ice and snow cover have already transformed annual light budgets in large areas of the Arctic and Antarctic, and both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are likely to experience further significant change in light. The interaction between ice-loss and solar irradiance renders polar ecosystems acutely vulnerable to abrupt ecosystem change, as light-driven tipping points are readily breached by relatively slight shifts in the timing of snow and ice-loss.},

  abstract = {Climate change is a major threat to global biodiversity. Antarctic ecosystems are no exception. Investigating past species responses to climatic events can distinguish natural from anthropogenic impacts. Climate change produces `winners', species that benefit from these events and `losers', species that decline or become extinct. Using molecular techniques, we assess the demographic history and population structure of Pygoscelis penguins in the Scotia Arc related to climate warming after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). All three pygoscelid penguins responded positively to post-LGM warming by expanding from glacial refugia, with those breeding at higher latitudes expanding most. Northern (Pygoscelis papua papua) and Southern (Pygoscelis papua ellsworthii) gentoo sub-species likely diverged during the LGM. Comparing historical responses with the literature on current trends, we see Southern gentoo penguins are responding to current warming as they did during post-LGM warming, expanding their range southwards. Conversely, Ad\'elie and chinstrap penguins are experiencing a `reversal of fortunes' as they are now declining in the Antarctic Peninsula, the opposite of their response to post-LGM warming. This suggests current climate warming has decoupled historic population responses in the Antarctic Peninsula, favoring generalist gentoo penguins as climate change `winners', while Ad\'elie and chinstrap penguins have become climate change `losers'.},

  abstract = {Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) is a large notothenioid fish that supports valuable fisheries throughout the Southern Ocean. D. eleginoides are found on the southern shelves and slopes of South America and around the sub-Antarctic islands of the Southern Ocean. Patagonian toothfish are a long-lived species ({$>$}50 years), which initially grow rapidly on the shallow shelf areas, before undertaking an ontogenetic migration into deeper water. Although they are active predators and scavengers, there is no evidence of large-scale geographic migrations, and studies using genetics, biochemistry, parasite fauna and tagging indicate a high degree of isolation between populations in the Indian Ocean, South Georgia and the Patagonian Shelf. Patagonian toothfish spawn in deep water (ca. 1000m) during the austral winter, producing pelagic eggs and larvae. Larvae switch to a demersal habitat at around 100mm (1-year-old) and inhabit relatively shallow water ({$<$}300m) until 6\textendash 7 years of age, when they begin a gradual migration into deeper water. As juveniles in shallow water, toothfish are primarily piscivorous, consuming the most abundant suitably sized local prey. With increasing size and habitat depth, the diet diversifies and includes more scavenging. Toothfish have weakly mineralised skeletons and a high fat content in muscle, which helps neutral buoyancy, but limits swimming capacity. Toothfish generally swim with labriform motion, but are capable of more rapid sub-carangiform swimming when startled. Toothfish were first caught as a by-catch (as juveniles) in shallow trawl fisheries, but following the development of deep water longlining, fisheries rapidly developed throughout the Southern Ocean. The initial rapid expansion of the fishery, which led to a peak of over 40,000tonnes in reported landings in 1995, was accompanied by problems of bird by-catch and overexploitation as a consequence of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU). These problems have now largely been addressed, but continued vigilance is required to ensure that the species is sustainably exploited and the ecosystem effects of the fisheries are minimised.},

Opening and closing nets were used to investigate patterns in the distribution and abundance of mesopelagic fish from the surface to 1000m on a series of transects across the Scotia Sea from the ice-edge to the Antarctic Polar Front. A total of 141 non-target net hauls were undertaken during three cruises (Nov 2006, Jan 2008 and Mar 2009), with 7852 teleost fish captured, representing 43 species in 17 families. A further 1517 fish were caught in targeted net hauls. The dominant families were the Myctophidae (6961 specimens; 21 species) and Bathylagidae (1467 specimens; 4 species). Few fish were caught in the upper 400m during daylight, which was attributed to a combination of net avoidance and diurnal vertical migration. Species composition was linked to depth and location and was closely associated with oceanographic features. Diversity was lowest in cold water at the most southerly stations, which were dominated by Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Bathylagus antarcticus. Further north, diversity increased with the addition of species such as Krefftichthys anderssoni, Protomyctophum bolini and Electrona carlsbergi. The depth integrated biomass of myctophids was similar across the latitudinal transect and produced an estimate of 4.5 million tonnes in the Scotia Sea. Bathylagids were patchily distributed, but were abundant in the lower mesopelagic zone ({$>$}400m) and are potentially significant zooplankton consumers. Given the biomass of the myctophids and bathylagids coupled with the vertical migrations of many species, these fish are likely to play a significant role in carbon export from the surface waters to the deep ocean.},

  abstract = {Antarctic and Southern Ocean (ASO) marine ecosystems have been changing for at least the last 30 years, including in response to increasing ocean temperatures and changes in the extent and seasonality of sea ice; the magnitude and direction of these changes differ between regions around Antarctica that could see populations of the same species changing differently in different regions. This article reviews current and expected changes in ASO physical habitats in response to climate change. It then reviews how these changes may impact the autecology of marine biota of this polar region: microbes, zooplankton, salps, Antarctic krill, fish, cephalopods, marine mammals, seabirds, and benthos. The general prognosis for ASO marine habitats is for an overall warming and freshening, strengthening of westerly winds, with a potential pole-ward movement of those winds and the frontal systems, and an increase in ocean eddy activity. Many habitat parameters will have regionally specific changes, particularly relating to sea ice characteristics and seasonal dynamics. Lower trophic levels are expected to move south as the ocean conditions in which they are currently found move pole-ward. For Antarctic krill and finfish, the latitudinal breadth of their range will depend on their tolerance of warming oceans and changes to productivity. Ocean acidification is a concern not only for calcifying organisms but also for crustaceans such as Antarctic krill; it is also likely to be the most important change in benthic habitats over the coming century. For marine mammals and birds, the expected changes primarily relate to their flexibility in moving to alternative locations for food and the energetic cost of longer or more complex foraging trips for those that are bound to breeding colonies. Few species are sufficiently well studied to make comprehensive species-specific vulnerability assessments possible. Priorities for future work are discussed.},

However, the establishment of non-native organisms in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems may present an even greater threat than climate change itself.

  abstract = {Antarctica is seriously affected by climate change, particularly at the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) where a rapid regional warming is observed. Potter Cove is a WAP fjord at Shetland Islands that constitutes a biodiversity hotspot where over the last years, Potter Cove annual air temperatures averages increased by 0.66 \textdegree C, coastal glaciers declined, and suspended particulate matter increased due to ice melting. Macroalgae are the main energy source for all consumers and detritivores of Potter Cove. Some effects of climate change favor pioneer macroalgae species that exploit new ice-free areas and can also decline rates of photosynthesis and intensify competition between species due to the increase of suspended particulate matter. In this study, we evaluated possible consequences of climate change at Potter Cove food web by simulating the extinction of macroalgae and detritus using a topological approach with thresholds of extinction. Thresholds represent the minimum number of incoming links necessary for species' survival. When we simulated the extinctions of macroalgae species at random, a threshold of extinction beyond 50\% was necessary to obtain a significant number of secondary extinctions, while with a 75\% threshold a real collapse of the food web occurred. Our results indicate that Potter Cove food web is relative robust to macroalgae extinction. This is dramatically different from what has been found in other food webs, where the reduction of 10\% in prey intake caused a disproportionate increase of secondary extinctions. Robustness of the Potter Cove food web was mediated by omnivory and redundancy, which had an important relevance in this food web. When we eliminated larger-biomass species more secondary extinctions occurred, a similar response was observed when more connected species were deleted, yet there was no correlation between species of larger-biomass and high-degree. This similarity could be explained because both criteria involved key species that produced an emerging effect on the food web. In this way, large-biomass and high-degree species could be acting as source for species with few trophic interactions or low redundancy. Based on this work, we expect the Potter Cove food web to be robust to changes in macroalgae species caused by climate change until a high threshold of stress is reached, and then negative effects are expected to spread through the entire food web leading to its collapse.},

Potter Cove (25 de Mayo/King George Island) is one of the most biodiverse and studied fjords on the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), where climate change is affecting benthic and pelagic communities. This fjord ecosystem presents a considerable degree of environmental and species distribution heterogeneity across space: the outer portion of the cove is dominated by hard bottoms meanwhile the inner portion is dominated by soft bottoms. In this work, we have incorporated habitat type to a highly-resolved Antarctic food web, and evaluated its effects on different network metrics and proxies for various dimensions of stability. We considered a multidimensional perspective and employed simulation techniques to encompass variability. Our results showed that the incorporation of habitat type to Potter Cove food web analysis led to two different functional types of networks segregated on space: a green food web (in the outer cove) and a brown food web (in the inner cove). The green and the brown food webs showed significant differences in network structure and in some proxies for multidimensional stability (i.e. quasi sign-stability and omnivory), suggesting that these two food webs have different resilience to perturbations. However, there were no changes in network robustness when in silico experiments were performed. We conclude that habitat type plays a significant role in the structure and stability of Antarctic food webs, and should be taken into account to design effective conservation strategies.},

Todos los ecosistemas se ven expuestos, en mayor o menor medida, a las consecuencias de la actividad humana. Estas consecuencias se configuran como factores de estr\'es que ejercen presi\'on sobre los ecosistemas y pueden amenazar la conservaci\'on de las especies. De esta manera, las relaciones entre las especies se ven alteradas y pueden desencadenar cambios atrav\'es del ecosistema. Una de las relaciones determinantes para la din\'amica de los ecosistemas es la interacci\'on tr\'ofica presa-depredador. Estas interacciones ocurren en tramas de cientos de especies que conforman redes. Las redes tr\'oficas son entidades fundamentales para la comprensi\'on del funcionamiento de los ecosistemas y las comunidades biol\'ogicas. Una buena aproximaci\'on para el entendimiento de estas entidades es su representaci\'on en forma de grafo. Los grafos permiten estudiar distintos aspectos de la estructura y estabilidad de las redes y, adem\'as, permiten evaluar el impacto de cambios en las condiciones del sistema. El aumento de la temperatura por la crisis clim\'atica y la introducci\'on de especies invasoras son dos factores de estr\'es capaces de generar estos cambios y perturbar a los ecosistemas. En la presente tesis, seleccion\'e dos casos de estudio y evalu\'e el efecto que sendos estresores tienen sobre dos redes marinas costeras a trav\'es de perturbaciones en los componentes de las redes. La red tr\'ofica de caleta Potter (Isla 25 de Mayo, Ant\'artida) es uno de los casos de estudio donde se registr\'o un r\'apido aumento de la temperatura en los \'ultimos a\~nos. El otro caso es la red tr\'ofica del intermareal rocoso patag\'onico (Puerto Madryn, Golfo Nuevo) donde se registr\'o recientemente la llegada de una especie altamente invasora: el cangrejo verde (Carcinus maenas). Para el primer caso consider\'e el tipo de h\'abitat del ecosistema de la caleta, fondo duro y fondo blando, y evalu\'e el efecto de las perturbaciones sobre la red en ambos fondos. Para el segundo caso, fue necesario conducir primero un estudio de dieta del cangrejo invasor para luego incorporarlo a la red tr\'ofica. En ambos casos observ\'e que los factores estresores aqu\'i estudiados modifican la estructura de ambas redes tr\'oficas con consecuencias en la estabilidad de las redes.

Green crabs were first found on the Argentinian Patagonian coast in 2001 and were detected in Golfo Nuevo (Chubut, Argentina) in 2015. In this study, we described a rocky intertidal food web in the Golfo Nuevo and evaluated the effect of green crab invasion on the network. We assembled the intertidal food web from a compilation of diet studies and compared 2 scenarios: pre-invasion (without green crab) and post-invasion (with green crab). We calculated several structural network metrics to compare the scenarios. The green crab was positioned as a top predator in the intertidal food web, consuming prey from different trophic levels and exhibiting the capacity to exert top-down control. Green crab presence altered the structure and stability of the food web. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of potential competitive interactions between native species and the green crab on the food web. Possible competitive interactions increased the effect the green crab had on the structure of the food web. Our results show that green crab invasion decreased food web stability by reducing the capacity of the food web to contain small- and long-range disturbances. These results contribute to the assessment and monitoring of the possible effects of other factors of global change. The system is less stable than before green crab invasion, and the drastic changes in community composition already recorded in rocky intertidal ecosystems in Patagonia are more likely to amplify through the food web.},

  abstract = {Large quantities of microplastics end up in the marine environment, constituting a potential threat for many organisms even in remote protected areas where the extent of this type of pollution is still unknown. This study evaluated for the first time the occurrence of microplastics in benthic organisms from the Marine Protected Area Namuncur\'a at Burdwood Bank, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. Microplastics were isolated from the soft tissue of the sea stars Henricia obesa and Odontaster penicillatus using an oxidative treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The chemical composition of the particles was identified with Raman spectroscopy. Fibers and fragments were found in similar proportions in both species. Fibers were identified as semi-synthetic cellulose, while the polymeric composition of fragments was masked by the synthetic pigment Phthalo blue. Over half of the sea stars contained microplastics (61\%). In H. obesa, the mean abundance was 1.00\,{$\pm$}\,1.03 particles per individual and 3.34\,{$\pm$}\,4.13 particles per gram, and in O. penicillatus, the mean abundance was 2.70\,{$\pm$}\,2.91 particles per individual and 1.94\,{$\pm$}\,2.09 particles per gram. Fibers were predominantly blue, and all fragments were bluish/turquoise. Microplastic sizes ranged from 24 to 1340~\textmu m, and most particles (approximately 90\%) were less than 1~mm. These results provide a baseline assessment of the abundance and type of microplastics in benthic organisms from this sub-Antarctic protected area and contribute to the scant data on microplastic pollution in the South Atlantic Ocean.},

The scientific community has declared stressor interactions\textemdash notably synergies\textemdash a key issue for conservation and management. Here, we review ecological literature over the past four decades to evaluate trends in the reporting of ecological interactions (synergies, antagonisms and additive effects) and highlight the implications and importance to conservation. Despite increasing popularity, and ever-finer terminologies, we find that synergies are (still) not the most prevalent type of interaction, and that conservation practitioners need to appreciate and manage for all interaction outcomes, including antagonistic and additive effects. However, it will not be possible to identify the effect of every interaction on every organism's physiology and every ecosystem function because the number of stressors, and their potential interactions, are growing rapidly. Predicting the type of interactions may be possible in the near-future, using meta-analyses, conservation-oriented experiments and adaptive monitoring. Pending a general framework for predicting interactions, conservation management should enact interventions that are robust to uncertainty in interaction type and that continue to bolster biological resilience in a stressful world.},

  abstract = {Humans impact natural systems in a multitude of ways, yet the cumulative effect of multiple stressors on ecological communities remains largely unknown. Here we synthesized 171 studies that manipulated two or more stressors in marine and coastal systems and found that cumulative effects in individual studies were additive (26\%), synergistic (36\%), and antagonistic (38\%). The overall interaction effect across all studies was synergistic, but interaction type varied by response level (community: antagonistic, population: synergistic), trophic level (autotrophs: antagonistic, heterotrophs: synergistic), and specific stressor pair (seven pairs additive, three pairs each synergistic and antagonistic). Addition of a third stressor changed interaction effects significantly in two-thirds of all cases and doubled the number of synergistic interactions. Given that most studies were performed in laboratories where stressor effects can be carefully isolated, these three-stressor results suggest that synergies may be quite common in nature where more than two stressors almost always coexist. While significant gaps exist in multiple stressor research, our results suggest an immediate need to account for stressor interactions in ecological studies and conservation planning.},

  abstract = {A planktonic food-web model including sixty-three functional nodes (representing auto- mixo- and heterotrophs) was developed to integrate most trophic diversity present in the plankton. The model was implemented in two variants - which we named `green' and `blue' - characterized by opposite amounts of phytoplankton biomass and representing, respectively, bloom and non-bloom states of the system. Taxonomically disaggregated food-webs described herein allowed to shed light on how components of the plankton community changed their trophic behavior in the two different conditions and modified the overall functioning of the plankton food web. The green and blue food-webs showed distinct organizations in terms of trophic roles of the nodes and carbon fluxes between them. Such re-organization stemmed from switches in selective grazing by both metazoan and protozoan consumers. Switches in food-web structure resulted in relatively small differences in the efficiency of material transfer towards higher trophic levels. For instance, from green to blue states, a seven-fold decrease in phytoplankton biomass translated into only a two-fold decrease in potential planktivorous fish biomass. By linking diversity, structure and function in the plankton food-web, we discuss the role of internal mechanisms, relying on species-specific functionalities, in driving the `adaptive' responses of plankton communities to perturbations.},

  abstract = {High-latitude oceans have been identified as particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification if anthropogenic CO2 emissions continue. Marine microbes are an essential part of the marine food web and are a critical link in biogeochemical processes in the ocean, such as the cycling of nutrients and carbon. Despite this, the response of Antarctic marine microbial communities to ocean acidification is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of increasing fCO2 on the growth of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNFs), nano- and picophytoplankton, and prokaryotes (heterotrophic Bacteria and Archaea) in a natural coastal Antarctic marine microbial community from Prydz Bay, East Antarctica. At CO2 levels {$\geq$}634\&thinsp;\textmu atm, HNF abundance was reduced, coinciding with increased abundance of picophytoplankton and prokaryotes. This increase in picophytoplankton and prokaryote abundance was likely due to a reduction in top-down control of grazing HNFs. Nanophytoplankton abundance was elevated in the 634\&thinsp;\textmu atm treatment, suggesting that moderate increases in CO2 may stimulate growth. The taxonomic and morphological differences in CO2 tolerance we observed are likely to favour dominance of microbial communities by prokaryotes, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton. Such changes in predator\textendash prey interactions with ocean acidification could have a significant effect on the food web and biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean, intensifying organic-matter recycling in surface waters; reducing vertical carbon flux; and reducing the quality, quantity, and availability of food for higher trophic levels.},

This has resulted in a 0.4\textdegree C rise in sea temperature in the last 50 years, five days of sea ice lost per decade and increased ice scouring in the shallows. The WAP shallows are ideal for studying the biological response to physical change because most known Antarctic species are benthic, physical change occurs mainly in the shallows and most research stations are coastal. Studies at Rothera Station have found increased benthic disturbance with losses of winter sea ice and assemblage-level changes coincident with this ice scouring. Such studies are difficult to scale up as they depend on SCUBA diving \textendash{} a very spatially limited technique. Here we report attempts to broaden the understanding of benthic ecosystem responses to physical change by replicating the Rothera experimental grids at Carlini Station through collaboration between the UK, Argentina and Germany across Signy, Rothera and Carlini stations. We argue that such collaborations are the way forward towards understanding the big picture of biota responses to physical climate changes at a regional scale.},

  abstract = {The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is a hotspot of physical climate change, especially glacial retreat, particularly in its northern South Shetland Islands (SSI) region. Along coastlines, this process is opening up new ice-free areas, for colonization by a high biodiversity of flora and fauna. At Potter Cove, in the SSI (Isla 25 de Mayo/King George Island), Antarctica, colonization by macroalgae was studied in two newly ice-free areas, a low glacier influence area (LGI), and a high glacier influence area (HGI) differing in the presence of sediment run-off and light penetration, which are driven by levels of glacial influence. We installed artificial substrates (tiles) at 5~m depth to analyze benthic algal colonization and succession for four years (2010\textendash 2014). Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR, 400\textendash 700~nm), temperature, salinity, and turbidity were monitored at both sites in spring and summer. The turbidity and the light attenuation (Kd) were significantly lower at LGI than at HGI. All tiles were colonized by benthic algae, differing in species identity and successional patterns between areas, and with a significantly higher richness at LGI than HGI in the last year of the experiment. We scaled up a quadrat survey on the natural substrate to estimate benthic algal colonization in newly deglaciated areas across Potter Cove. Warming in recent decades has exposed much new habitat, with macroalgae making up an important part of colonist communities `chasing' such glacier retreat. Our estimation of algal colonization in newly ice-free areas shows an expansion of {$\sim$}0.005\textendash 0.012~km2 with a carbon standing stock of {$\sim$}0.2\textendash 0.4~C tons, per year. Life moving into new space in such emerging fjords has the potential to be key for new carbon sinks and export. In sustained climate change scenarios, we expect that the processes of colonization and expansion of benthic assemblages will continue and generate significant transformations in Antarctic coastal ecosystems by increasing primary production, providing new structures, food and refuge to fauna, and capturing and storing more carbon.},

To describe size composition and natural diet of beach strandings and swarms, samples from strandings were taken in April 2007, March 2008 and March 2010. Samples from swarms were taken in May 2007 and April 2010. Also, during November 2008 and January 2009, two acoustic surveys were carried out to describe both, horizontal distribution and school metrics of swarms. Pelagic swarms and beach strandings were composed of 100\% individuals of the morph gregaria of M. gregaria. Mean size of males and females in both, beach strandings and swarms, were similar. The diet of pelagic M. gregaria was composed mainly of crustaceans, unicellular algae and small macroalgae, sediment and particulate organic matter. Swarms of pelagic Munida took the shape of extended layers of varying density and height. Their positions in the water column were also variable: swarms were found at different depths, from the subsurface layer to near the sea bottom. Occasionally, some large swarms occupied most of the water column. In the Beagle Channel, SW winds during spring tides could be a forcing factor for M. gregaria strandings. The absence of shoaling animals in the Beagle Channel between 1997 and 2002 and the recent occurrence of swarms are coincident with their appearance in other locations in Patagonia. In consequence, we hypothesize that the factor influencing the formation of swarms must be acting at a regional scale.},

  abstract = {Microplastics debris in the marine environment have been widely studied across the globe. Within these particles, the most abundant and prevalent type in the oceans are anthropogenic microfibers (MFs), although they have been historically overlooked mostly due to methodological constraints. MFs are currently considered omnipresent in natural environments, however, contrary to the Northern Hemisphere, data on their abundance and distribution in Southern Oceans ecosystems are still scarce, in particular for sub-Antarctic regions. Using Niskin bottles we've explored microfibers abundance and distribution in the water column (3\textendash 2450~m depth) at the Burdwood Bank (BB), a seamount located at the southern extreme of the Patagonian shelf, in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The MFs detected from filtered water samples were photographed and measured using ImageJ software, to estimate length, width, and the projected surface area of each particle. Our results indicate that small pieces of fibers are widespread in the water column at the BB (mean of 17.4~{$\pm~$}12.6~MFs.L-1), from which, 10.6~{$\pm~$}5.3~MFs.L-1 were at the surface (3\textendash 10~m depth), 20~{$\pm~$}9~MFs.L-1 in intermediate waters (41\textendash 97~m), 24.6~{$\pm~$}17.3~MFs.L-1 in deeper waters (102\textendash 164~m), and 9.2~{$\pm~$}5.3~MFs.L-1 within the slope break of the seamount. Approximately 76.1\% of the MFs were composed of Polyethylene terephthalate, and the abundance was dominated by the size fraction from 0.1 to 0.3~mm of length. Given the high relative abundance of small and aged MFs, and the oceanographic complexity of the study area, we postulate that MFs are most likely transported to the BB via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Our findings imply that this sub-Antarctic protected ecosystem is highly exposed to microplastic pollution, and this threat could be spreading towards the highly productive waters, north of the study area.},

Here, the effects of atmospheric changes projected in 2100 on this relationship were examined with a 5-km resolution ocean/sea ice/ice shelf model of the Southern Ocean with different simulated dissolved iron sources and idealized biological uptake. The atmospheric changes are added as idealized increments to the forcing. Inclusion of a poleward shift and strengthening of the winds, increased precipitation, and warmer atmospheric temperatures resulted in doubling of the heat advected onto the continental shelf and an 83\% increase in the total Antarctic ice shelf basal melt. The total dissolved iron supply to the surface waters over the continental shelf increased by 62\%, while the surface iron supply due just to basal melt driven overturning increased by 48\%. However, even though the ice shelf driven contribution becomes less important to the total iron supply on average (29\% of total), the ice shelf involvement becomes relatively even more important in some locations, such as the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. The modified atmospheric conditions also produced a reduction in summer sea ice extent and a shoaling of the summer mixed layers. These simulated responses to projected changes suggest relief of light and nutrient limitation for phytoplankton blooms over the Antarctic continental shelf and perhaps an increase in annual production in years to come.},

  abstract = {Penguins accumulate mercury due to their long-life span together with their high trophic position. We sampled adult and juveniles' feathers from three colonies of Spheniscus magellanicus from Tierra del Fuego along an inshore-offshore corridor. We integrated toxicological information (mercury concentrations) and foraging biomarkers ({$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N) into a common data analysis framework (isotopic niche analysis) to evaluate the influence of age, location, and foraging behaviors on mercury concentrations. Adults had higher feather mercury concentrations, {$\delta$}13C, and {$\delta$}15N values compared to juveniles. Also, adult and juvenile feather mercury concentrations differed between colonies, with lower mercury concentrations at the nearest inshore colony relative to the farther offshore colonies. Trophic position and the isotopic niche analyses suggest that this geographic gradient in mercury concentrations is due to differences in colonies' foraging areas. Understanding penguins' exposure to mercury derived from local food webs is a crucial first step in evaluating the impacts of this heavy metal on their conservation status.},

Spatial and seasonal variations of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase and lipid peroxidation in gills and digestive gland were analyzed in relation to environmental parameters, heavy metals in sediment and in tissue. Four sites with anthropogenic impact and a control site were selected and monitored during the four seasons of 2007. We found significant differences among sites in concentrations of dissolved nutrients and heavy metals in sediments, with the highest values recorded at sites with anthropogenic pressure. Different patterns were observed between concentrations of metals in tissues and in sediments suggesting differences in bioavailability. There were also significant differences in biomarker responses among sites, despite the strong seasonal variability. Our results showed relatively moderate levels of pollution in the study area as a result of urban influences.},

  abstract = {Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of ecosystems requires integrating diversity within trophic levels (horizontal diversity) and across trophic levels (vertical diversity, including food chain length and omnivory). We review theoretical and experimental progress toward this goal. Generally, experiments show that biomass and resource use increase similarly with horizontal diversity of either producers or consumers. Among prey, higher diversity often increases resistance to predation, due to increased probability of including inedible species and reduced efficiency of specialist predators confronted with diverse prey. Among predators, changing diversity can cascade to affect plant biomass, but the strength and sign of this effect depend on the degree of omnivory and prey behaviour. Horizontal and vertical diversity also interact: adding a trophic level can qualitatively change diversity effects at adjacent levels. Multitrophic interactions produce a richer variety of diversity-functioning relationships than the monotonic changes predicted for single trophic levels. This complexity depends on the degree of consumer dietary generalism, trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance to predation, intraguild predation and openness to migration. Although complementarity and selection effects occur in both animals and plants, few studies have conclusively documented the mechanisms mediating diversity effects. Understanding how biodiversity affects functioning of complex ecosystems will benefit from integrating theory and experiments with simulations and network-based approaches.},

Large-bodied, shallow-water species are at greatest risk and five out of the seven most threatened families are rays. Overall chondrichthyan extinction risk is substantially higher than for most other vertebrates, and only one-third of species are considered safe. Population depletion has occurred throughout the world's ice-free waters, but is particularly prevalent in the Indo-Pacific Biodiversity Triangle and Mediterranean Sea.

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

  abstract = {In this paper we provide the first report of the presence of exotic Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in two rivers off the Beagle Channel, Lapataia and Ovando, in southern Tierra del Fuego. We also confirm that successful reproduction occurred in the fall of 2007, as we captured yearlings in freshwater. Scale pattern analyses of adult fish caught were all of the ``stream'' ecotype, with ages ranging between 3 and 5 (average 4.2~year). Stable isotope analysis of Ovando-Lapataia Chinook population indicates general patterns consistent with those of other populations in the region, but characteristically enriched levels of C indicates a distinct ocean feeding location as compared to Atlantic populations in the Santa Cruz River. Two different haplotypes, one identical to the unique haplotype of the Caterina River population, were found in the Ovando-Lapataia rivers, providing partial evidence for some level of contemporary segregation between these two populations. As an exotic species, Chinook salmon have been able to use the ocean as a waterway to rapidly colonize new habitats both in New Zealand and in several Pacific and Atlantic river basins of continental Patagonia. This record expands the known distribution of this species in Patagonia further south and into the Island of Tierra del Fuego. Its presence in the Beagle Channel creates the conditions for its expansion to a significant collection of new rivers, as well as to adjacent marine areas in and around the Southern Fuegian Channels. Our results provide support to the idea that, in practice, no district of Patagonia is sheltered from the colonization by invasive anadromous Salmonids.},

Ushuaia city, the biggest settlement on the channel, exerts an increasing anthropogenic pressure by discharges of urban and in\- dustrial effluents. In the present work, we use Patagonotothen tessellata, one of the most abundant and widespread species in the channel, as a bioindicator species in order to evidence anthropic impact from Ushuaia Bay and surrounding areas. We first analyzed and characterized real time gene expression of androgen receptor, estrogen receptor and different forms of vitellogenin (VTG), under laboratory conditions. This was achieved by induction with estradiol of P. tessellata males. Then, the selected genes were used as biomarkers for an environmental biomonitoring study. Morphometric indices and circulating sex steroids (estradiol and testosterone) were also quantified in male fish collected from different sites. The qPCR analysis showed that vtgAb form is more inducible than vtgAa or vtgC forms after estrogen induction. The field survey revealed the up-regulation of vtgAb and the androgen receptor in fish from sites with higher anthropogenic influence. Sex steroids followed seasonal variations according to their reproductive cycle, with higher levels of estradiol and testosterone in winter and summer seasons. The use of biomarkers such as gene expression of VTG demonstrates that fish from Ushuaia Bay are likely to be exposed to endocrine disrupting compounds. To our knowledge, this research is the first attempt to assess the endocrine disruption associated to anthropic impact in a widespread fish of the Beagle Channel and contributes to a better understanding of the reproductive physiology of sub Antarctic ichthyofauna.},

  abstract = {Antarctic krill Euphausia superba (hereafter `krill') occur in regions undergoing rapid environmental change, particularly loss of winter sea ice. During recent years, harvesting of krill has increased, possibly enhancing stress on krill and Antarctic ecosystems. Here we review the overall impact of climate change on krill and Antarctic ecosystems, discuss implications for an ecosystem-based fisheries management approach and identify critical knowledge gaps. Sea ice decline, ocean warming and other environmental stressors act in concert to modify the abundance, distribution and life cycle of krill. Although some of these changes can have positive effects on krill, their cumulative impact is most likely negative. Recruitment, driven largely by the winter survival of larval krill, is probably the population parameter most susceptible to climate change. Predicting changes to krill populations is urgent, because they will seriously impact Antarctic ecosystems. Such predictions, however, are complicated by an intense inter-annual variability in recruitment success and krill abundance. To improve the responsiveness of the ecosystem-based management approach adopted by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), critical knowledge gaps need to be filled. In addition to a better understanding of the factors influencing recruitment, management will require a better understanding of the resilience and the genetic plasticity of krill life stages, and a quantitative understanding of under-ice and benthic habitat use. Current precautionary management measures of CCAMLR should be maintained until a better understanding of these processes has been achieved.},

We provide evidence of a regional breeding failure of emperor penguin colonies due to sea ice loss using Sentinel2 satellite imagery. Of the five breeding sites in the region all but one experienced total breeding failure after sea ice break-up before the start of the fledging period of the 2022 breeding season.

  abstract = {Strandings of marine animals are relatively common in marine systems. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We observed mass strandings of krill in Antarctica that appeared to be linked to the presence of glacial meltwater. Climate-induced glacial meltwater leads to an increased occurrence of suspended particles in the sea, which is known to affect the physiology of aquatic organisms. Here, we study the effect of suspended inorganic particles on krill in relation to krill mortality events observed in Potter Cove, Antarctica, between 2003 and 2012. The experimental results showed that large quantities of lithogenic particles affected krill feeding, absorption capacity and performance after only 24\,h of exposure. Negative effects were related to both the threshold concentrations and the size of the suspended particles. Analysis of the stomach contents of stranded krill showed large quantities of large particles (\,{$>$}\,106{$\mu$}m3), which were most likely mobilized by glacial meltwater. Ongoing climate-induced glacial melting may impact the coastal ecosystems of Antarctica that rely on krill.},

  abstract = {Trawling is the main fishing practice worldwide and its ecosystem effects have been raising concern over the past decades. Long-term impacts can be monitored through changes in the trophic structure, and several studies evaluated trophic level (TL) shifts in fish populations between trawled and untrawled environments. However, published results are contrasting. We performed a metanalysis integrating all available studies that evaluated TL shifts in fishes between trawled and untrawled environments and conducted a local study comparing several features of the trophic ecology in two species of fishes. According to the metanalysis, TL does not change significantly with trawling. In contrast, the local study showed higher TLs and broader isotopic niches in the trawled environment. Diet reconstruction indicated a potential consumption of hake, the main discard component, at the trawled environment. All the studies used in the metanalysis were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the local study represents the first data available from the Southern Hemisphere. As industrial commercial fisheries in Argentina are relatively recent, it is possible that our data are capturing the initial stage of ecological changes induced by trawling, compared with the historical fisheries located at the Northern Hemisphere.},

  abstract = {Demersal fisheries are one of the top anthropic stressors in marine environments. In the long term, some species are more vulnerable to fishery impacts than others, which can lead to permanent changes on the food web. The trophic relationships between predator and prey constitute the food web and it represents a network of the energy channels in an ecosystem. In turn, the network structure influences ecosystem diversity and stability. The first aim of this study was to describe for the first time the food web of the San Jorge Gulf (Patagonia Argentina) with high resolution, i.e.~to the species level when information is available. The San Jorge Gulf was subject to intense fisheries thus our second aim is to analyse the food web structure with and without fishery to evaluate if the bottom-trawl industrial fishery altered the network structure and stability. We used several network metrics like: mean trophic level, omnivory, modularity and quasi-sign stability. We included these metrics because they are related to stability and can be evaluated using predator diets that can weight the links between predators and prey. The network presented 165 species organized in almost five trophic levels. The inclusion of a fishery node adds 69 new trophic links. All weighted and unweighted metrics showed differences between the two networks, reflecting a decrease in stability when fishery was included in the system. Thus, our results suggested a probable change of state of the system. The observed changes in species abundances since the fishery was established, could represent the state change predicted by network analysis. Our results suggests that changes in the stability of food webs can be used to evaluate the impacts of human activity on ecosystems.},

In this chapter, we reconstructed the coastal fish assemblages and their changes in richness and composition in three areas at northern, central, and southern Patagonia between 1970 and 2020. Overall, there was an increase in fish richness (30 species) driven by an influx of species from warmer waters in northern and central Patagonia and by the invasion of alien species at central and southern Patagonia. Such a trend is consistent with the global pattern of tropicalization in temperate waters described for other regions and recent evidence of change in the sea surface temperature (SST) up to 48\textdegree S latitude. We detected only two local extinctions of skates from warm waters that disappeared from the northern area. A large number of fishes (30 species) diminished their frequency of occurrence. A total of 20 species of commercial importance, 7 of which were elasmobranchs, were the most affected by partial losses. Future research is needed to understand the functional role of the species arriving or retracting and the consequences of such changes on ecosystem functioning.},

The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of glacier melting on the composition and structure of phytoplankton and micro- and mesozooplankton assemblages in two coastal areas located in the northwest (Potter Cove) and in the northern end (Hope Bay) of the Antarctic Peninsula during summer 2013. We expect differences in plankton assemblages between PC and HB related to the fact that these areas are subjected to different climatic and environmental conditions and that the glacier meltwater is accumulated in lakes in HB whereas the meltwater directly reaches the adjacent sea at PC. However, plankton communities differed according to their proximity to the glaciers in both areas investigated, with a transition from herbivorous to microbial plankton food webs towards the glacier. The microbial food web was favored under the effects of glacier meltwater due to the stratification of the water column that favors the development of small eukaryotic algae. These are potential prey for ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates which, in turn, favors the development of small omnivorous copepods. Further away from the glaciers, the herbivorous food web consists of large phytoplankton and a greater representation of herbivorous mesozooplankton organisms. It can be inferred from this study that increases in atmospheric temperatures may favor the development of microbial plankton food webs in the Antarctic coastal seas during summer due to increased glacier meltwater.},

We compared sea otter counts conducted from small boats throughout the Sound during the summers of 1984 and 1985 to counts made after the spill during the summer of 1989. We used ratio estimators, corrected for sighting probability, to calculate otter densities and population estimates for portions of the Sound affected by the oil spill. We estimated the otter population in the portion of Prince William Sound affected by the oil was 6,546 at the time of the spill and that the post-spill population in the summer of 1989 was 3,898, yielding a loss estimate of approximately 2,650. Bootstrapping techniques were used to approximate confidence limits on the loss estimate of about 500\textendash 5,000 otters. The wide confidence limits are a result of the complex scheme required to estimate losses and limitations of the data. Despite the uncertainty of the loss estimate it is clear that a significant fraction of the otters in the spill zone survived. We observed otters persisting in relatively clean embayments throughout the oil spill zone suggesting that the highly convoluted coastline of Prince William Sound produced refuges that allowed some sea otters in the oil spill area to survive.},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding how changes in biodiversity will impact the stability and functioning of ecosystems is a central challenge in ecology. Food web approaches have been advocated to link community composition with ecosystem functioning by describing the fluxes of energy among species or trophic groups. However, estimating such fluxes remain problematic because current methods become unmanageable as network complexity increases. We developed a generalization of previous indirect estimation methods assuming a steady-state system (Hunt et al., ); the model estimates energy fluxes in a top-down manner assuming system equilibrium; each node's losses (consumption and physiological) balances its consumptive gains. Jointly, we provide theoretical and practical guidelines to use the fluxweb R package (available on CRAN at https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/fluxweb/index.html). We also present how the framework can merge with the allometric theory of ecology (Brown, Gillooly, Allen, Savage, to calculate fluxes based on easily obtainable organism-level data (i.e., body masses and species groups?e.g., plants, animals), opening its use to food webs of all complexities. Physiological losses (metabolic losses or losses due to death other than from predation within the food web) may be directly measured or estimated using allometric relationships based on the metabolic theory of ecology, and losses and gains due to predation are a function of ecological efficiencies that describe the proportion of energy that is used for biomass production. The primary output is a matrix of fluxes among the nodes of the food web. These fluxes can be used to describe the role of a species, a function of interest (e.g., predation; total fluxes to predators), multiple functions, or total energy flux (system throughflow or multitrophic functioning). Additionally, the package includes functions to calculate network stability based on the Jacobian matrix, providing insight into how resilient the network is to small perturbations at steady state. Overall, fluxweb provides a flexible set of functions that greatly increase the feasibility of implementing food web energetic approaches to more complex systems. As such, the package facilitates novel opportunities for mechanistically linking quantitative food webs and ecosystem functioning in real and dynamic natural landscapes.},

  abstract = {Ecologists have long sought to understand how diversity and structure mediate the stability of whole ecosystems. For high-diversity food webs, the interactions between species are typically represented using matrices with randomly chosen interaction strengths. Unfortunately, this procedure tends to produce ecological systems with no underlying equilibrium solution, and so ecological inferences from this approach may be biased by nonbiological outcomes. Using recent computationally efficient methodological advances from metabolic networks, we employ for the first time an inverse approach to diversity\textendash stability research. We compare classical random interaction matrices of realistic food web topology (hereafter the classical model) to feasible, biologically constrained, webs produced using the inverse approach. We show that an energetically constrained feasible model yields a far higher proportion of stable high-diversity webs than the classical random matrix approach. When we examine the energetically constrained interaction strength distributions of these matrix models, we find that although these diverse webs have consistent negative self-regulation, they do not require strong self-regulation to persist. These energetically constrained diverse webs instead show an increasing preponderance of weak interactions that are known to increase local stability. Further examination shows that some of these weak interactions naturally appear to arise in the model food webs from a constraint-generated realistic generalist\textendash specialist trade-off, whereby generalist predators have weaker interactions than more specialized species. Additionally, the inverse technique we present here has enormous promise for understanding the role of the biological structure behind stable high-diversity webs and for linking empirical data to the theory.},

  abstract = {Climate change impacts on fishery resources have been widely reported worldwide. Nevertheless, a knowledge gap remains for the warm-temperate Southwest Atlantic Ocean\textemdash a global warming hotspot that sustains important industrial and small-scale fisheries. By combining a trait-based framework and long-term landing records, we assessed species' sensitivity to climate change and potential changes in the distribution of important fishery resources (n\,=\,28; i.e., bony fishes, chondrichthyans, crustaceans, and mollusks) in Southern Brazil, Uruguay, and the northern shelf of Argentina. Most species showed moderate or high sensitivity, with mollusks (e.g., sedentary bivalves and snails) being the group with the highest sensitivity, followed by chondrichthyans. Bony fishes showed low and moderate sensitivities, while crustacean sensitivities were species-specific. The stock and/or conservation status overall contributed the most to higher sensitivity. Between 1989 and 2019, species with low and moderate sensitivity dominated regional landings, regardless of the jurisdiction analyzed. A considerable fraction of these landings consisted of species scoring high or very high on an indicator for potential to change their current distribution. These results suggest that although the bulk of past landings were from relatively climate-resilient species, future catches and even entire benthic fisheries may be jeopardized because (1) some exploited species showed high or very high sensitivities and (2) the increase in the relative representation of landings in species whose distribution may change. This paper provides novel results and insights relevant for fisheries management from a region where the effects of climate change have been overlooked, and which lacks a coordinated governance system for climate-resilient fisheries.},

Benthic fluxes of nutrients and dissolved oxygen were assessed in situ using opaque chambers. In northwest zone of UB, carbon equivalents of proteins and carbohydrates in surficial sediments were the same order as in hypertrophic ecosystems, whereas ammonium and phosphate released from sediment greatly exceeded the allochthonous sources. Management of municipal wastewater is required to remediate this chronic pollution.},

  abstract = {The Notothenioidei are a typical example of stenothermal fishes since most species have evolved and lived in Antarctic waters, where the water temperature is low and stable. This fact enabled them to evolve physiological characteristics related to cold. Nevertheless, some species came out of Antarctic waters a few million years ago and coped with more variable thermal regimes. This work aims to determine the thermal tolerance and preference of two sub-Antarctic notothenioid species found in Southern South America, Patagonotothen tessellata and Harpagifer bispinis, adding valuable information about thermal adaptation mechanisms. Experiments were conducted after exposing their juveniles for three weeks at 4, 7, 10 and 12 \textdegree C. Their thermal tolerance limits were established using the Critical Thermal Methodology and their acute thermal preferenda, employing a horizontal thermal gradient tank. Fishes acclimated to different exposure temperatures had small to intermediate thermal tolerance polygons (P. tessellata: 593.85\textdegree C2, H. bispinis: 475.40 \textdegree C2) and positive relationships between preferred and acclimation temperatures. The Final Temperature Preferenda were estimated to be 14.25 \textdegree C for P. tessellata and 13.05 \textdegree C for H. bispinis, allowing to characterize them as cold eurythermal species, with P. tessellata more tolerant to heat and H. bispinis more tolerant to cold. Their different thermal sensitivities are in agreement with their different thermal histories and distributions. In a climate change context, the increase of sea surface temperatures is likely to reduce the northern boundaries of their distributions. Conversely, it can potentially enhance both species' performances at their southernmost distribution limits since those environments are cooler than their maximum thermal tolerances.},

Remotely sensed information was combined with on-board observer's data and published information to investigate the role of distinctive oceanographic features in relation to the life cycle of the Patagonian red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), main target of the industrial fleet in SJG. Three frontal systems\textemdash North, South and Outer SJG\textemdash are characterized. The North and South SJG fronts are associated with shrimp reproductive aggregations during late spring and summer. While both function as spawning/nursery grounds, they differ from each other in many respects. The thermohaline South SJG front has its maximum expression during the winter, reflecting the influence of the low-salinity Magellanic Plume, while the thermal North SJG front develops during spring and summer as the water column becomes stratified in the central basin of the gulf. Wind-related down-welling inshore of the front prevails in the North SJG, and upwelling in the South SJG frontal area. Chlorophyll a is concentrated near the thermocline on the stratified side of the North SJG, and for that reason, it is not detected by remote sensors during the spring bloom and the summer but becomes apparent offshore from the location of the front when the thermocline deepens during the fall (May). In the South SJG front, Chl-a concentration is apparent inshore from the front all year-round, related in part to upwelling-mediated resuspension. The northern end of the outer front coincides in time and space with a recurrent non-reproductive aggregation of red shrimp between November and January and is presumably related to foraging. It is argued that keeping the North and South SJG frontal systems off-limits to fishing is a central precautionary requisite for the sustainability of the shrimp fishery.},

This region is characterized by high biological productivity, and by an exceptional tidal regime that interacts with the subpolar Falkland/Malvinas (FM) current. The results presented contribute to the development of an ecohydrodynamic system intended for the study of the implications of increasing exploitation of natural resources in the region. Detailed tidal charts show the propagation on the continental shelf of tidal waves related to clockwise amphidromes in the South Atlantic, indicating the occurrence of resonance. The averaged velocity field is dominated by the FM current, although tidal residuals around headlands are significant on the Patagonian coast. In contrast, ``snapshots'' describe the interaction between the tides and the FM current, where the flow patterns displayed are expected to influence the population dynamics of biological species. The mean wind stress induces strong currents and a large anticlockwise circulation cell northeast of Tierra del Fuego. The strong tidal and FM currents generate shelf sea fronts whose locations, revealed by contours of the Simpson-Hunter parameter, are related to major fishing grounds. Because of the lack of velocity measurements in the region, the FM and wind-driven currents simulated by the model should be taken as experimental results until proper comparisons with observations can be made.},

We compare ecosystem models parameterized before and after the onset of recent heatwaves to evaluate the cascading effects on ecosystem structure and function in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. While the ecosystem-level contribution, as prey, and demand, as predators, of most functional groups changed, gelatinous taxa experienced the largest transformations, underscored by the arrival of northward-expanding pyrosomes. Despite altered trophic relationships and energy flux, the post-heatwave ecosystem appears stable, suggesting a shift to a novel ecosystem state, with potentially profound consequences for ecosystem structure, energy flows, and threatened and harvested species.},

  abstract = {We studied discard use and incidental mortality of seabirds attracted to high-sea trawl vessels operating in the Golfo San Jorge, Argentina, during the height of the fishing season in 2003 and 2004. Fourteen seabird species ate food made available by fishing operations. The most frequent and abundant seabirds (percent occurrence, mean number per haul) were the kelp gull Larus dominicanus (98.9\%, 207.0), the black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophrys (98.9\%, 94.2) and the white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis (91\%, 8.4). Flock sizes for the 3 species varied from a few to a maximum of 1600 birds. Total seabird abundance varied significantly between stages of the fishing operation, being higher during discarding and haulback than during towing. Incidental capture of seabirds in nets was recorded in 37\% of 89 hauls, with a mean capture rate of 1.2 birds per haul. Species incidentally caught were the great shearwater Puffinus gravis, the imperial cormorant Phalacrocorax atriceps and the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, with rates that varied between months and years. Considering the fishery's fishing effort, the estimated total numbers of birds killed during the study were 2254 great shearwaters (CV = 1.1), 1233 imperial cormorants (CV = 1.1) and 35 Magellanic penguins (CV = 2.4) in 2003, and 311 imperial cormorants (CV = 1.7) and 1516 Magellanic penguins (CV = 1.1) in 2004. Black-browed albatrosses and kelp gulls were also struck by the warp cable while feeding on discards from the surface, and drowned when they were dragged underwater. The results obtained in this study show that the hake trawl fishery operating in the Golfo San Jorge may have a significant effect on some seabird populations through the provision of fishing discards and incidental mortality.},

Observations were made onboard hake (January 2007) and shrimp vessels (November 2008). The Kelp Gull and Black-browed Albatross were the most frequent and abundant seabirds at both fisheries, while Argentine Hake (Merluccius hubbsi) dominated the composition of discards. Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses consumed 91\% of experimentally discarded hake (n~=~1236). Mean sizes of prey consumed by gulls were 22.4 and 23.7~cm in the hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively, while those of prey consumed by albatrosses were 28.5 and 31.3~cm, respectively. In both fisheries, gulls selected the smaller prey available ({$<$}25 and {$<~$}30~cm in hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively) while Black-browed Albatrosses selected the larger prey available ({$>$}25 and {$>$}30~cm in hake and shrimp fisheries, respectively). Intraspecific and interspecific kleptoparasitism were significantly more frequent than expected in Kelp Gulls and Black-browed Albatrosses, respectively. Robbing efficiency was clearly higher in albatrosses than gulls. In both species, sizes of prey consumed by direct capture were significantly smaller than those stolen, and the rate of kleptoparasitism increased with prey size. Gulls stole significantly smaller prey than albatrosses. Prey selection by Kelp Gulls is affected by the interaction with Black-browed Albatrosses, and the degree at which discards are used by both species appears to depend on the fishery considered, the food on offer and the selection of prey sizes according to seabird species-specific preferences.},

This work investigates the exchange between these two LMEs and its seasonal and interannual variability by employing numerical model results and offline particle-tracking algorithms. Our analysis suggests a general poleward transport on the southern region of the HLME, a well-defined flux from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and equatorward transport on the PLME.  Lagrangian simulations show that the majority of the southern PS waters originate from the upper layer in the southeast South Pacific (\&lt;200\&thinsp;m), mainly from the southern Chile and Cape Horn shelves. The exchange takes place through the Le Maire Strait, Magellan Strait, and the shelf break. These inflows amount to a net northeastward transport of 0.88\&thinsp;Sv at 51{$\circ\&$}thinsp;S in the southern PLME. The transport across the Magellan Strait is small (0.1\&thinsp;Sv), but due to its relatively low salinity it greatly impacts the density and surface circulation of the coastal waters of the southern PLME. The water masses flowing into the Malvinas Embayment eventually reach the PLME through the Malvinas Shelf and occupy the outer part of the shelf. The seasonal and interannual variability of the transport are also addressed. On the southern PLME, the interannual variability of the shelf exchange is partly explained by the large-scale wind variability, which in turn is partly associated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index (r=0.52).},

  abstract = {A quantitative assessment of observed and projected environmental changes in the Southern Ocean (SO) with a potential impact on the marine ecosystem shows: (i) large proportions of the SO are and will be affected by one or more climate change processes; areas projected to be affected in the future are larger than areas that are already under environmental stress, (ii) areas affected by changes in sea-ice in the past and likely in the future are much larger than areas affected by ocean warming. The smallest areas ({$<$}1\% area of the SO) are affected by glacier retreat and warming in the deeper euphotic layer. In the future, decrease in the sea-ice is expected to be widespread. Changes in iceberg impact resulting from further collapse of ice-shelves can potentially affect large parts of shelf and ephemerally in the off-shore regions. However, aragonite undersaturation (acidification) might become one of the biggest problems for the Antarctic marine ecosystem by affecting almost the entire SO. Direct and indirect impacts of various environmental changes to the three major habitats, sea-ice, pelagic and benthos and their biota are complex. The areas affected by environmental stressors range from 33\% of the SO for a single stressor, 11\% for two and 2\% for three, to {$<$}1\% for four and five overlapping factors. In the future, areas expected to be affected by 2 and 3 overlapping factors are equally large, including potential iceberg changes, and together cover almost 86\% of the SO ecosystem.},

Ten key messages emerged that have stakeholder-relevance and/or a high impact for the scientific community. They address (i) altered biogeochemical cycles, (ii) ocean acidification, (iii) climate change hotspots, (iv) unexpected dynamism in seabed-dwelling populations, (v) spatial range shifts, (vi) adaptation and thermal resilience, (vii) sea ice related biological fluctuations, (viii) pollution, (ix) endangered terrestrial endemism and (x) the discovery of unknown habitats. Most Antarctic biotas are exposed to multiple stresses and considered vulnerable to environmental change due to narrow tolerance ranges, rapid change, projected circumpolar impacts, low potential for timely genetic adaptation, and migration barriers. Important ecosystem functions, such as primary production and energy transfer between trophic levels, have already changed, and biodiversity patterns have shifted. A confidence assessment of the degree of `scientific understanding' revealed an intermediate level for most of the more detailed sub-messages, indicating that process-oriented research has been successful in the past decade. Additional efforts are necessary, however, to achieve the level of robustness in scientific knowledge that is required to inform protection measures of the unique Antarctic terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and their contributions to global biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Southern Ocean waters are among the most vulnerable to ocean acidification. The projected increase in the CO2 level will cause changes in carbonate chemistry that are likely to be damaging to organisms inhabiting these waters. A meta-analysis was undertaken to examine the vulnerability of Antarctic marine biota occupying waters south of 60\textdegree S to ocean acidification. This meta-analysis showed that ocean acidification negatively affects autotrophic organisms, mainly phytoplankton, at CO2 levels above 1,000 {$\mu$}atm and invertebrates above 1,500 {$\mu$}atm, but positively affects bacterial abundance. The sensitivity of phytoplankton to ocean acidification was influenced by the experimental procedure used. Natural, mixed communities were more sensitive than single species in culture and showed a decline in chlorophyll a concentration, productivity, and photosynthetic health, as well as a shift in community composition at CO2 levels above 1,000 {$\mu$}atm. Invertebrates showed reduced fertilization rates and increased occurrence of larval abnormalities, as well as decreased calcification rates and increased shell dissolution with any increase in CO2 level above 1,500 {$\mu$}atm. Assessment of the vulnerability of fish and macroalgae to ocean acidification was limited by the number of studies available. Overall, this analysis indicates that many marine organisms in the Southern Ocean are likely to be susceptible to ocean acidification and thereby likely to change their contribution to ecosystem services in the future. Further studies are required to address the poor spatial coverage, lack of community or ecosystem-level studies, and the largely unknown potential for organisms to acclimate and/or adapt to the changing conditions.},

  abstract = {Coastal areas of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) constitute a rich and biodiverse marine zone. Despite these ecosystems being supported by the microorganism's activity, the structure of microbial communities is insufficiently studied. As WAP is the area most affected by global warming worldwide, the increased glacier melting caused by the global warming and the consequent increase of the water runoff could be deeply affecting these microbial communities. To advance knowledge about the structure of microbial communities and its response to the environmental factors, a full-year study of marine bacterioplankton was conducted at Potter Cove, Antarctica. Multivariate analysis based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and environmental data revealed a seasonal pattern in the structure of the bacterioplankton community, with spring\textendash summer clustering separately from autumn\textendash winter samples. Salinity, temperature and particulated matter were the main environmental driving forces. Based on the seasonal patterns, five bacterial clone libraries were performed from three sampling sites (E1, inner cove; E2, outer cove; and E3, mouth of a creek). Phylogenetic analysis of libraries generated 301 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), revealing the enormous richness and high diversity of these communities. Proteobacteria (68\%), Bacteroidetes (20\%) and Actinobacteria (8\%) were the most represented phyla. During summer, bacterial community from E1 resembled that observed in E3, whereas during winter it resembled the E2 community. Results evidenced the influence of glacial meltwater input and showed the high variability of the bacterioplankton from inner cove. This study contributes to the better understanding of the structure of the Potter Cove marine ecosystems and could be reflecting the behavior of other similar ecosystems from WAP.},

We show that existing analyses using trophic models have generally ignored a number of important factors including (1) the high level of natural variability of forage fish, (2) the weak relationship between forage fish spawning stock size and recruitment and the role of environmental productivity regimes, (3) the size distribution of forage fish, their predators and subsequent size selective predation (4) the changes in spatial distribution of the forage fish as it influences the reproductive success of predators. We show that taking account of these factors generally tends to make the impact of fishing forage fish on their predators less than estimated from trophic models. We also explore the empirical relationship between forage fish abundance and predator abundance for a range of U.S. fisheries and show that there is little evidence for a strong connection between forage fish abundance and the rate of change in the abundance of their predators. We suggest that any evaluation of harvest policies for forage fish needs to include these issues, and that models tailored for individual species and ecosystems are needed to guide fisheries management policy.},

  abstract = {Foodweb models provide a useful framework for compiling data on biomass, production, consumption and feeding relationships. They are particularly useful for identifying gaps and inconsistencies in the data, and for exploring plausible scenarios of change. We compiled data on the pelagic foodweb of the South Georgia shelf, which is one of the most intensively studied areas in the Southern Ocean. The data suggest that current average annual copepod production is three times that of Antarctic krill and that flying seabirds and fish are, respectively, responsible for 25\% and 21\% of local krill consumption. The most striking inconsistency was that estimated consumption of fish was 5 times their estimated production. We developed a static mass balance model of the foodweb representing one of many possible solutions to the inconsistencies in the data. The model included sufficient fish biomass to balance the original consumption estimate, and consequently fish became the main krill consumers. Nonetheless, only 74\% of local krill production was consumed by predators, suggesting that there are additional mortality sources that we did not explicitly model. We developed further models to explore scenarios incorporating plausible climate-driven reductions in krill biomass. In scenarios with unchanged predator diets, an 80\% reduction in krill biomass resulted in a 73\% reduction in vertebrate biomass. However, when predators with diverse diets were able to switch to feeding on alternative zooplankton prey, total vertebrate biomass was maintained at current levels. Scenarios in which 80\% of krill biomass was replaced with copepod biomass required 28\% more primary production because the estimated consumption rate of copepods is higher than that of krill. The additional copepod biomass did not alter the consequences for vertebrates. These scenarios illustrate the wide range of potential consequences of a shift from a krill to a copepod dominated system in a warming climate. They suggest that both maintenance and dramatic reduction of vertebrate production are plausible outcomes, although the former requires major changes in predator diets.},

The fishery and the summer foraging sites of many of these predators are concentrated between 0\textdegree{} and 90\textdegree W. Parts of this quadrant have experienced recent localised sea surface warming of up to 0.2\textdegree C per decade, and projections suggest that further widespread warming of 0.27\textdegree{} to 1.08\textdegree C will occur by the late 21st century. We assessed the potential influence of this projected warming on Antarctic krill habitat with a statistical model that links growth to temperature and chlorophyll concentration. The results divide the quadrant into two zones: a band around the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in which habitat quality is particularly vulnerable to warming, and a southern area which is relatively insensitive. Our analysis suggests that the direct effects of warming could reduce the area of growth habitat by up to 20\%. The reduction in growth habitat within the range of predators, such as Antarctic fur seals, that forage from breeding sites on South Georgia could be up to 55\%, and the habitat's ability to support Antarctic krill biomass production within this range could be reduced by up to 68\%. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the effects of a 50\% change in summer chlorophyll concentration could be more significant than the direct effects of warming. A reduction in primary production could lead to further habitat degradation but, even if chlorophyll increased by 50\%, projected warming would still cause some degradation of the habitat accessible to predators. While there is considerable uncertainty in these projections, they suggest that future climate change could have a significant negative effect on Antarctic krill growth habitat and, consequently, on Southern Ocean biodiversity and ecosystem services.},

Here, using assemblage-level tracking of marine predators, we identify AESs for this globally important region and assess current threats and protection levels. Integration of more than 4,000 tracks from 17 bird and mammal species reveals AESs around sub-Antarctic islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and over the Antarctic continental shelf. Fishing pressure is disproportionately concentrated inside AESs, and climate change over the next century is predicted to impose pressure on these areas, particularly around the Antarctic continent. At present, 7.1\% of the ocean south of 40\textdegree S is under formal protection, including 29\% of the total AESs. The establishment and regular revision of networks of protection that encompass AESs are needed to provide long-term mitigation of growing pressures on Southern Ocean ecosystems.},

In this study, we investigated how changes in the general sedimentation and shading patterns affect the primary production by benthic microalgae, the microphytobenthos. In order to determine potential net primary production and respiration of the microphytobenthic community, sediment cores from locations exposed to different sedimentation rates and shading were exposed to PAR of 0\textendash 70 \textmu mol photons m-2 s-1. Total oxygen exchange rates and microphytobenthic diatom community structure, density, and biomass were determined. Our study revealed that while the microphytobenthic diatom density and composition remained similar, the net primary production of the microphytobenthos decreased with increasing sedimentation and shading. By comparing our experimental results with in situ measured PAR intensities, we furthermore identified microphytobenthic primary production as an important carbon source within Potter Cove's benthic ecosystem. We propose that the microphytobenthic contribution to the total primary production may drop drastically due to Antarctic glacial retreat and related sedimentation and shading, with yet unknown consequences for the benthic heterotrophic community, its structure, and diversity.},

  abstract = {Coastal food webs that are supported by multiple primary producer sources are considered to be more stable against perturbations. Here, we investigated how declining macroalgal abundance and diversity might influence coastal food web structure along an annual sea ice cover gradient along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). The most common benthic invertebrate consumers, macroalgae, and surface particulate organic matter were collected at 15 stations along the WAP. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of primary producers changed negligibly in relation to the sea ice cover gradient, while isotope values of most invertebrate feeding groups increased with higher sea ice cover, although at low explanatory power. Food web length became shorter and consumer trophic niche width smaller in regions with higher sea ice cover. Changes in food web structure were mostly associated with shifts in trophic position of lower trophic levels. Food web structure in higher ice-covered regions resembled that of more generalist feeders with a loss of specialist species, concurrent with an increased reliance on a more reworked detrital food source. These results suggest that a number of benthic invertebrates are able to adjust to differences in basal energy sources. Conversely, these food webs dominated by generalist feeders are likely less efficient in energy transfer, which can create less-stable systems with lower adaptive capacity to disturbance. The predicted sea ice loss along the WAP may ultimately lead to a longer food web with higher macroalgal abundance, more specialist species, and wider consumer trophic niches in the currently more ice-covered regions.},

Post-spill densities of several species of marine birds were lower than expected in the oiled area of Prince William Sound when compared to densities in the unoiled area. These negative effects continued through 1998 for five taxa: cormorants, goldeneyes, mergansers, Pigeon Guillemot (Cepphus columba), and murres. Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) and Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) exhibited negative effects in 1990 and 1991. Loons showed a weak negative effect in 1993. Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) showed relative decreases in 1989, 1996, and 1998 which may have been caused by shifts in foraging distribution rather than declines in populations. Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens) showed positive effects in most post-spill years. Murrelets and terns showed relative increases in 1993, 1996, and 1998. Generally, taxa that dive for their food were negatively affected, whereas taxa that feed at the surface were not. Effects for some taxa were dependent upon the spatial scale at which they were analyzed. Movements of birds and the mosaic pattern of oiling reduced our ability to detect oil-spill effects, therefore our results may be conservative. Several marine bird species were negatively affected at the population level and have not recovered to pre-spill levels nine years after the oil spill. The reason for lack of recovery may be related to persistent oil remaining in the environment and reduced forage fish abundance.},

  abstract = {The continental shelves of the Weddell Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula vicinity host abundant macrobenthic communities, and the persistence of which is facing serious global change threats. The current relationship among pelagic energy production, its distribution over the shelf, and macrobenthic consumption is a ``clockwork'' mechanism that has evolved over thousands of years. Together with biological processes such as production, consumption, reproduction, and competence, it also involves ice (e.g., sea ice, ice shelves, and icebergs), wind, and water currents, among the most important physical controls. This bio-physical machinery undergoes environmental changes that most likely will compromise the persistence of the valuable biodiversity pool that Antarctic macrobenthic communities host. Scientific evidence shows that ongoing environmental change leads to primary production increases and also suggests that, in contrast, macrobenthic biomass and the organic carbon concentration in the sediment may decrease. Warming and acidification may affect the existence of the current Weddell Sea and Antarctic Peninsula shelf macrobenthic communities earlier than other global change agents. Species with the ability to cope with warmer water may have a greater chance of persisting together with allochthonous colonizers. The Antarctic macrobenthos biodiversity pool is a valuable ecosystem service that is under serious threat, and establishing marine protected areas may not be sufficient to preserve it.},

Moreover, stressors are usually defined in an anthropocentric context: what we consider a short-term stressor, such as a flood, will span multiple generations of microbes. We argue that to predict responses to multiple stressors from individuals to the whole ecosystem, it is necessary to consider metabolic rates, which determine the timescales at which individuals operate and therefore, ultimately, the ecological memory at different levels of ecological organization.},

  abstract = {Human-induced habitat destruction, overexploitation, introduction of alien species and climate change are causing species to go extinct at unprecedented rates, from local to global scales. There are growing concerns that these kinds of disturbances alter important functions of ecosystems. Our current understanding is that key parameters of a community (e.g. its functional diversity, species composition, and presence/absence of vulnerable species) reflect an ecological network's ability to resist or rebound from change in response to pressures and disturbances, such as species loss. If the food web structure is relatively simple, we can analyse the roles of different species interactions in determining how environmental impacts translate into species loss. However, when ecosystems harbour species-rich communities, as is the case in most natural systems, then the complex network of ecological interactions makes it a far more challenging task to perceive how species' functional roles influence the consequences of species loss. One approach to deal with such complexity is to focus on the functional traits of species in order to identify their respective roles: for instance, large species seem to be more susceptible to extinction than smaller species. Here, we introduce and analyse the marine food web from the high Antarctic Weddell Sea Shelf to illustrate the role of species traits in relation to network robustness of this complex food web. Our approach was threefold: firstly, we applied a new classification system to all species, grouping them by traits other than body size; secondly, we tested the relationship between body size and food web parameters within and across these groups and finally, we calculated food web robustness. We addressed questions regarding (i) patterns of species functional/trophic roles, (ii) relationships between species functional roles and body size and (iii) the role of species body size in terms of network robustness. Our results show that when analyzing relationships between trophic structure, body size and network structure, the diversity of predatory species types needs to be considered in future studies.},

  abstract = {Valuing, managing and conserving marine biodiversity and a full range of ecosystem services is at the forefront of research and policy agendas. However, biodiversity is being lost at up to a thousand times the average background rate. Traditional disciplinary and siloed conservation approaches are not able to tackle this massive loss of biodiversity because they generally ignore or overlook the interactive and dynamic nature of ecosystems processes, limiting their predictability. To conserve marine biodiversity, we must assess the interactions and impacts among biodiversity and ecosystem services (BD-ES). The scaling up in complexity from single species to entire communities is necessary, albeit challenging, for a deeper understanding of how ecosystem services relate to biodiversity and the roles species have in ecosystem service provision. These interactions are challenging to map, let alone fully assess, but network and system-based approaches provide a powerful way to progress beyond those limitations. Here, we introduce a conceptual multi-layered network approach to understanding how ecosystem services supported by biodiversity drive the total service provision, how different stressors impact BD-ES and where conservation efforts should be placed to optimize the delivery of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity.

The spatial structure and biogeochemical composition of inshore habitats are shaped by large quantities of terrigenous particulate material deposited in the vicinity of the coast, which impacts the pelagic and benthic ecosystems.

Two hundred and ninety-one half hour counts were made in the Antarctic region between October 18 and November 16, 1988 (+94 counts in sub-antarctic and sub-tropical water). The bird populations were dominated by the Ad\'elie Penguin Pygoscelis adeliae, which represented 90\% of the birds counted in the closed pack ice (CPI), with a mean density of 31 penguins per km2. Crabeater seal Lobodon carcinophagus, the most common pinniped, had a mean density of 1.2/km2 in the CPI with local concentrations reaching 14/km2. Expressed as biomass, mean values of about 90 kg/km2 were found in the whole Antarctic zone for seabirds, 50 for seals, and 35 for baleen cetaceans. Densities were higher in the CPI: 140, 180 and 115 kg/km2 respectively, were found for birds, pinnipeds and baleen whales, and lowest in open water (8 kg/km2 for the birds, 0.2 for the pinnipeds and no whales). A minimum value of food intake by seabirds and marine mammals was estimated to be 2.7 mg C/m2/day for the Antarctic zone (4.1 in the CPI). Taking into account that pinnipeds density and cetacean food uptake are underestimated, and that Antarctic seabirds consume much more fish than generally suspected, a minimum krill production of 16 mg C/m2/day is proposed for the Antarctic zone: 22.5 in the CPI, 3 in open water, and intermediate values in the marginal ice zones.},

The effects spread through the community by direct and indirect interactions. The network perspective on ecology can help map the pathways of these effects, for food webs, the pathways of indirect trophic interactions. Indirect interactions typically decay in intensity as they spread. Therefore, there is a conceptual maximum range in topological space beyond which interactions have no effects, even though all species remain connected. Neither the local characteristics of species, nor the global characteristics of entire webs, suitably quantify this range. We therefore apply intermediate scale indices that reflect the limitations imposed by effect damping in networks. We present a complex analysis of the topological positional importance of species in the Chesapeake Bay web. This web is a carbon-flow network that represents trophic interactions. We present several different indices reflecting different properties and discuss which questions the different indices best answer. We look for the best indices for identifying the key players in ecosystem functioning. Our study contributes to the quantification of relative species importance and provides an exact and a priori determination of a class of candidate keystone species that can inform applied and conservation ecology as well as theoretical concerns.},

  abstract = {Conservation biology should focus more on the importance rather than the rarity of species, although the definition and quantification of importance are not easy. One approach involves measuring the positional importance (e.g. centrality) of species in ecological interaction networks to provide a basis for species ranking. However, there are many centrality indices, each reflecting a particular aspect of positional importance and therefore giving a rank order of species different from those provided by alternative formulations. Thus, there is a strong need for comparing the available indices and for examining their relative merits in network analysis. In this paper, we apply 13 centrality indices to the ``species'' (trophic components) of methodologically comparable trophic flow networks, in order to answer the following questions: (1) What is the disagreement between different indices regarding the rank of a given species in a given network? (2) How is this disagreement in performance influenced by the choice of the network? (3) What is the overall relationship among these indices and, in particular, which are the most similar to degree (the simplest index of all, being equal to the number of links pertaining to a given node)? We compare the 13 indices based on the data of nine networks using metric and rank statistics and multivariate analysis procedures. We conclude that (1) different centrality ranks differ in each network; (2) different webs can be characterized by different relationships between ranks but there is a robust pattern of relationships among the indices, some index pairs behaving very similarly in all networks; and (3) it is the index of closeness centrality which provides a rank most similar to that based on degree.},

We used a minimally realistic ecosystem model to examine how projected effects of ocean warming on the growth of Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, might affect populations of krill and dependent predators (whales, penguins, seals, and fish) in the Scotia Sea. We also investigated the potential to mitigate depletion risk for predators by curtailing krill fishing at different points in the 21st century. The projected effects of ocean warming on krill biomass were strongest in the northern Scotia Sea, with a {$\geq$}40\% decline in the mass of individual krill. Projections also suggest a 25\% chance that krill biomass will fall below an established depletion threshold (75\% of its unimpacted level), with consequent risks for some predator populations, especially penguins. Average penguin abundance declined by up to 30\% of its unimpacted level, with up to a 50\% chance of falling below the depletion threshold. Simulated krill fishing at currently permitted harvest rates further increased risks for depletion, and stopping fishing offset the increased risks associated with ocean warming in our model to some extent. These results varied by location and species group. Risk reductions at smaller spatial scales also differed from those at the regional level, which suggests that some predator populations may be more vulnerable than others to future changes in krill biomass. However, impacts on predators did not always map directly to those for krill. Our findings indicate the importance of identifying vulnerable marine populations and targeting protection measures at appropriate spatial scales, and the potential for spatially-structured management to avoid aggravating risks associated with rising ocean temperatures. This may help balance tradeoffs among marine ecosystem services in an uncertain future.},

Among the fastest moving species are boreal generalist fish which are expected to affect arctic marine food web structure and ecosystem functioning substantially. Here, we address structural changes at the food web level induced by poleward shifts via topological network analysis of highly resolved boreal and arctic food webs of the Barents Sea. We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations, thereby changing arctic marine food web structure considerably with implications for ecosystem dynamics and functioning.},

Yet, temporal studies of highly resolved food web structure are scarce. With few exceptions, most temporal food web studies are either too simplified, preventing a detailed assessment of structural properties or binary, missing the temporal dynamics of energy fluxes among species. Using long-term, multi-trophic biomass data coupled with highly resolved information on species feeding relationships, we analysed food web dynamics in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) over more than three decades (1981\textendash 2014). We combined unweighted (topology-based) and weighted (biomass- and flux-based) food web approaches, first, to unravel how distinct descriptors can highlight differences (or similarities) in food web dynamics through time, and second, to compare temporal dynamics of food web structure and function. We find that food web descriptors vary substantially and distinctively through time, likely reflecting different underlying ecosystem processes. While node- and link-weighted metrics reflect changes related to alterations in species dominance and fluxes, unweighted metrics are more sensitive to changes in species and link richness. Comparing unweighted, topology-based metrics and flux-based functions further indicates that temporal changes in functions cannot be predicted using unweighted food web structure. Rather, information on species population dynamics and weighted, flux-based networks should be included to better comprehend temporal food web dynamics. By integrating unweighted, node- and link-weighted metrics, we here demonstrate how different approaches can be used to compare food web structure and function, and identify complementary patterns of change in temporal food web dynamics, which enables a more complete understanding of the ecological processes at play in ecosystems undergoing change.},

  abstract = {The relationship between omnivory and stability has been the subject of a longstanding debate in ecology. Early theory predicted that omnivory would decrease the probability of food webs being stable. While early empirical data appeared to support the prediction that omnivory should be rare, detailed study of food webs later revealed that omnivory is ubiquitous across ecosystems and taxa. Recent years have seen renewed interest in the omnivory-stability debate, and advances in mechanistic non-equilibrium models demonstrated that omnivory can both increase and decrease stability. Current efforts have therefore focused on identifying biological mechanisms that promote the persistence of food webs with omnivory. We synthesize recent evidence that omnivory often stabilizes food webs when it occurs as life-history omnivory, when prey experience reduced predation rates due to refuges or adaptive antipredator defences, and when omnivores interfere with each other or feed adaptively. Empirical research has lagged behind theory and there remains a shortage of studies directly measuring the stability of diverse natural communities that vary in the number and strength of omnivorous interactions. Early microcosm experiments indicated a narrow range of conditions for the persistence of simple omnivorous modules, while studies of omnivory embedded within larger natural networks have demonstrated its stabilizing effects. These new findings alter our view of food web dynamics and show that rather than looking for a simple and general omnivory-stability relationship, we should focus on identifying conditions under which omnivory is a stabilizing feature of more complex natural systems.},

Particularly, in the inner part of Potter Cove (South Shetland Islands, Antarctica) large areas are now exposed to open sea conditions owing to the retreat of Fourcade glacier. During the 2010 austral summer, underwater photographic surveys were undertaken by SCUBA diving up to 30 m in these new ice-free areas 80 m from the glacier front. Our main aim was to investigate colonization and early succession of the benthic assemblages on soft-bottom areas. Here, we reported a total of 1,146 animals belonging to 13 taxa. Filter-feeders comprised the largest trophic group and sessile fauna showed much higher coverages and densities than mobile fauna at all depths.

  abstract = {The Antarctic Peninsula is among the places on Earth that registered major warming in the last 60 yr. Massive ice losses, represented by glacier retreat, ice-shelf collapses and sea-ice reduction are among the main impacts of this regional warming. The loss of sea-bed ice coverage, on the one hand has been affecting benthic assemblages, but on the other it is opening up new areas for benthic colonisation. Potter Cove (South Shetland Islands) offered the opportunity of assessing both processes. We recently reported a sudden shift of benthic assemblages related to increased sedimentation rates caused by glacier retreat. This glacier retreat also uncovered a new island that presents a natural experiment to study Antarctic benthic colonisation and succession. We sampled the new island by photo-transects taken up to 30 m depth. Here, we report an unexpected benthic assemblage characterised by high species richness, diversity and structural complexity with a well-developed three-dimensional structure and epibiotic relationships. Filter feeders comprised the largest trophic group at all depths, mainly ascidians, sponges and bryozoans. Densities were also surprising, recording only six ascidian species with a mean of {$\sim$}310 ind. m\textendash 2. These values are at least an order of magnitude higher than previous Antarctic reports on early colonisation. This finding challenges the extended idea of a slow and continuous recruitment in Antarctica. However, it also opens the question of whether these complex assemblages could have been present under the glacier in ice-free refuges that are now exposed to open sea conditions. Under the current scenario of climate change, these results acquire high relevance as they suggest a two-fold effect of the Antarctic Peninsula warming: the environmental shifts that threaten coastal ecosystems, and also the opening up of new areas for colonisation that may occur at a previously unimagined speed.},

  abstract = {In the austral summer of 2020, record high temperatures were registered in the Western Antarctic Peninsula. This offered a unique opportunity to evaluate the effect of extreme sea surface temperature and natural heatwaves on the metabolic balance (i.e. the balance between production and respiration), lipid damage and the possible change in lipid composition of coastal Antarctic (Potter Cove, King George/25 de Mayo Island, South Shetlands) microbial communities. Two marine heatwaves, one in January and a second one in February 2020 showed mean temperatures of 1.8 {$\smwhtcircle$}C above the 20-year climatology values. During the first heatwave, a rapid and strong (60\%) decrease in microbial community biomass was observed, Criptophyceae were replaced by unidentified nano\- phytoflagellates and other heterotrophic groups. The community experienced an increase in heterotrophic metabolism via an increase in community respiration (CR, 12.79 mmolO2 m- 3d- 1) and a negative net community production (NCP, - 14.9 {$\pm$} 0.31 mmolO2 m- 3d- 1), leading to a production:respiration (P:R) rate {$<$} 1. Addi\- tionally, the most representative fatty acids (FAs: 14:0, 16:0, 18:0, 16:1{$\omega$}9, 18:1{$\omega$}9, 18:2{$\omega$}6 and 18:3{$\omega$}3) decreased, except for the monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) 16:1{$\omega$}9 and 18:1 {$\omega$}9, which increased during this first heatwave. In the second marine heatwave, total biomass dropped to the minimum values reported during the entire study. Here, CR was at its maximum (25.09 mmolO2 m- 3d- 1), but NCP was also positive (1.96 mmolO2 m- 3d- 1) and P:R {$>$} 1, associated with an active autotrophic community. Again, significant lipid damage, a decrease in saturated FAs and ‚çµ6 polyunsaturated FAs, and an increase in MUFAs occurred. This field study validates previous experimental results on changes in natural plankton composition and physiology under global warming scenarios.},

  abstract = {Microbial community metabolic balance (i.e., the ratio between photosynthesis and community respiration) is critical for assessing the strength of the biological carbon pump and its importance for the marine food web. This study aimed at characterizing the microbial community metabolic balance (hereinafter referred to as metabolic balance) in the Beagle Channel (BC, 54\textdegree S, 68\textdegree{} W), a sub-Antarctic environment that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans at the southernmost extreme of South America. During a binational Chilean-Argentinian cruise along the eastern BC in the austral spring (November 2019), oxygen production and consumption rates were estimated in vitro after 12-h light and dark incubations. Phytoplankton primary productivity was additionally assessed using in vivo active fluorescence techniques. Environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, carbonate system and light) and the composition of the plankton community (i.e., phytoplankton and bacteria) were analyzed to assess the factors controlling productivity in the BC. Finally, we explored the role of the microbial community metabolic balance in modulating CO2 uptake by means of high-resolution underway CO2 fugacities (fCO2). Results showed a highly dynamic and rapidly changing system, with gross primary production (GPP) rates presenting a west-east gradient, with minimum values in the western portion of the study area (0.63~{$\pm~$}0.12~mmol O2 m-3 d-1) and maximum values towards the Atlantic (13.87~{$\pm~$}2.00~mmol O2 m-3 d-1). Community respiration rates were high (mean: 2.81~mmol O2 m-3 d-1) and positively correlated with GPP. Although net community production (NCP) was relatively low (0.25\textendash 3.27~mmol O2 m-3d-1), the P:R ratio suggests the prevalence of autotrophic communities, dominated by chain forming diatoms, mainly in the eastern portion (NCP : 3.27~mmol O2 m-3 d-1). Thermohaline conditions played a key role in regulating the productive capacity of the BC and in the sea-air CO2 exchange, except in the most productive stations, where biological production fueled fCO2 dynamics.},

  abstract = {The accepted paradigm for reproduction in Antarctic marine species is one where oogenesis takes 18~months to 2~years, and a bimodal egg-size distribution where two cohorts of eggs are present in female gonads throughout the year. These slow gametogenic traits are driven by low temperature and/or the restriction of resource availability because of extreme seasonality in the marine environment. Here we present data on the reproductive ecology of the common Antarctic bivalve Aequiyoldia eightsii (Jay, 1839) (Protobranchia: Sarepidae) from monthly samples collected between January 2013 and May 2014 at Hangar Cove, Rothera Point on the West Antarctic Peninsula. These data show that A. eightsii is unusual because it does not follow the typical pattern expected for reproduction in Antarctic marine invertebrates, and differs also from closely related nuculanid protobranch bivalves with respect to gametogenic duration and reproductive periodicity. Continuous oogenesis, evidenced by the year-round occurrence of previtellogenic, vitellogenic, and ripe oocytes in female gonads, is supplemented by a seasonal increase in reproductive intensity and spawning in Austral winter (April\textendash May), evidenced by the loss of mature spermatozoa and ripe oocytes from males and females, respectively. The simultaneous occurrence of these contrasting traits in individuals is attributed to a flexible feeding strategy (suspension and deposit feeding) in response to seasonal changes in food supply characteristic of the Antarctic marine environment. Asynchrony between individual females is also notable. We hypothesise that the variability may represent a trade-off between somatic and reproductive growth, and previously reported internal interannual cycles in shell growth.},

  abstract = {In recent years glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula have retreated, resulting in loss of mass from ice shelves and increased supply of icebergs to the Southern Ocean. Free-drifting icebergs may serve as an important source of Fe to surrounding waters. We measured concentrations of dissolved Fe and Fe content of suspended particulate material (via flow injection-chemiluminescence and ICP-MS, respectively) in the waters surrounding several icebergs during cruises to the Scotia and Weddell Seas in June 2008 and March 2009. Surface dissolved Fe (DFe) concentrations varied from 0.58 to 2.92nM and were elevated up to 60\% at some stations {$<$}1km from the nearest iceberg. The highest surface DFe concentrations were associated with low salinity waters, regardless of distance to the iceberg. Depth profiles revealed surface enrichment at most stations {$>$}10km from the icebergs, indicating general Fe enrichment in the lower-salinity surface layer. However surface DFe within 1km of the iceberg was similar to that measured at depths below the draft of the iceberg, a feature that may result from upwelling of circumpolar deep water caused by basal melting at the face of the iceberg. Iron concentrations in ice collected following calving events were highly variable (4-600nM) but were elevated above concentrations in seawater. Particulate Fe (normalized to particulate P) in suspended particulate material was up to 20-fold higher within 0.6km of two large tabular icebergs, but no enrichment was observed at two smaller icebergs. Iron:phosphorus ratios of suspended particulate material were also higher in deeper (40m) waters compared to shallow (ca. 15m) waters at the iceberg face. Iron release appeared to be episodic, producing a spatially heterogeneous environment around icebergs. This source term may increase in coming years as Antarctic ice shelves degrade further, potentially impacting the ecology and biogeochemistry of low-Fe waters of the Southern Ocean.},

Here, using a 5-year dataset of eukaryotic plankton DNA metabarcoding, we assess changes in biodiversity and net community production in this region. Our results show that sea-ice extent is a dominant factor influencing eukaryotic plankton community composition, biodiversity, and net community production. Species richness and evenness decline with an increase in sea surface temperature (SST). In regions with low SST and shallow mixed layers, the community was dominated by a diverse assemblage of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Conversely, less diverse plankton assemblages were observed in waters with higher SST and/or deep mixed layers when sea ice extent was lower. A genetic programming machine-learning model explained up to 80\% of the net community production variability at the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Among the biological explanatory variables, the sea-ice environment associated plankton assemblage is the best predictor of net community production. We conclude that eukaryotic plankton diversity and carbon cycling at the Western Antarctic Peninsula are strongly linked to sea-ice conditions.},

We have assessed salp consumption as a proportion of net primary production, and found correlations between herbivore densities and integrated chlorophyll-a that indicate that there is a degree of competition between krill and salps. Our analysis of the relationship between annual sea-ice cover and a longer time series of air temperature measurements12,13 indicates a decreased frequency of winters with extensive sea-ice development over the last five decades. Our data suggest that decreased krill availability may affect the levels of their vertebrate predators.

Biodiversity decreases with latitude in decapod crustaceans but increases southward in most benthic invertebrate groups. Patagonian rocky shores are exposed to harsh physical conditions resulting in intense desiccation of intertidal organisms, which can be expected to get worse in future scenarios of global climate change. A change to be anticipated in the Patagonian coast is the southward range shift of warm-temperate species, which can already be perceived in San Jorge gulf, where recent southward range extensions were detected in the distribution of several species. The most important changes during the last decades in the Patagonian coast were caused by the invasion of nonindigenous benthic invertebrates. The arrivals of the intertidal barnacle Balanus glandula, the crab Carcinus maenas, the sea slug Pleurobranchaea maculata, the tunicate Styela clava, and the reef-forming oyster Magallana gigas were the main invasions of marine invertebrates recorded in the region.

  abstract = {In the Southern Ocean (SO), plastic debris has already been found in waters and sediments. Nanoplastics ({$<$}1~{$\mu$}m) are expected to be as pervasive as their larger counterparts, but more harmful to biological systems, being able to enter cells and provoke toxicity. In the SO, (nano)plastic pollution occurs concomitantly with other environmental threats such as ocean acidification (OA), but the potential cumulative impact of these two challenges on SO marine ecosystems is still overlooked. Here the single and combined effects of nanoplastics and OA on the sub-Antarctic pteropod Limacina retroversa are investigated under laboratory conditions, using two surface charged polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs) as a proxy for nanoplastics. Sub-Antarctic pteropods are threatened by OA due to the sensitivity of their shells to changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. Short-term exposure (48~h) to PS NPs compromised the ability of pteropods to counteract OA stress, resulting in a negative effect on their survival. Our results highlights the importance of addressing plastic pollution in the context of climate change to identify realistic critical thresholds of SO pteropods.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of the food web structure and complexity are central to better understand ecosystem functioning. A food-web approach includes both species and energy flows among them, providing a natural framework for characterizing species' ecological roles and the mechanisms through which biodiversity influences ecosystem dynamics. Here we present for the first time a high-resolution food web for a marine ecosystem at Potter Cove (northern Antarctic Peninsula). Eleven food web properties were analyzed in order to document network complexity, structure and topology. We found a low linkage density (3.4), connectance (0.04) and omnivory percentage (45), as well as a short path length (1.8) and a low clustering coefficient (0.08). Furthermore, relating the structure of the food web to its dynamics, an exponential degree distribution (in- and out-links) was found. This suggests that the Potter Cove food web may be vulnerable if the most connected species became locally extinct. For two of the three more connected functional groups, competition overlap graphs imply high trophic interaction between demersal fish and niche specialization according to feeding strategies in amphipods. On the other hand, the prey overlap graph shows also that multiple energy pathways of carbon flux exist across benthic and pelagic habitats in the Potter Cove ecosystem. Although alternative food sources might add robustness to the web, network properties (low linkage density, connectance and omnivory) suggest fragility and potential trophic cascade effects.},

One such property is the small-world topology that combines a high clustering and a small distance between nodes of the network. This property may increase food web resilience but make them more sensitive to the extinction of connected species. Food web theory has been developed principally from freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, largely omitting marine habitats. If theory needs to be modified to accommodate observations from marine ecosystems, based on major differences in several topological characteristics is still on debate. Here we investigated if the small-world topology is a common structural pattern in marine food webs. We developed a novel, simple and statistically rigorous method to examine the largest set of complex marine food webs to date. More than half of the analyzed marine networks exhibited a similar or lower characteristic path length than the random expectation, whereas 39\% of the webs presented a significantly higher clustering than its random counterpart. Our method proved that 5 out of 28 networks fulfilled both features of the small-world topology: short path length and high clustering. This work represents the first rigorous analysis of the small-world topology and its associated features in high-quality marine networks. We conclude that such topology is a structural pattern that is not maximized in marine food webs; thus it is probably not an effective model to study robustness, stability and feasibility of marine ecosystems.},

In recent years, such approaches have been successfully applied to study polar ecosystems, improving our knowledge on how they might respond to ongoing environmental changes. The Weddell Sea is one of the most studied marine ecosystems outside the Antarctic Peninsula in the Southern Ocean. Yet, few studies consider the known complexity of the Weddell Sea food web, which in its current form comprises 490 species and 16041 predator-prey interactions. Here we analysed the Weddell Sea food web, focusing on the species and trophic interactions that underpin ecosystem structure and stability. We estimated the strength for each interaction in the food web, characterised species position in the food web using unweighted and weighted food web properties, and analysed species\&rsquo; roles with respect to the stability of the food web. We found that the distribution of the interaction strength (IS) at the food web level is asymmetric, with many weak interactions and few strong ones. We detected a positive relationship between species mean IS and two unweighted properties (i.e., trophic level and the total number of interactions). We also found that only a few species possess key positions in terms of food web stability. These species are characterised by high mean IS, mid to high trophic level, relatively high number of interactions, and mid to low trophic similarity. In this study, we integrated unweighted and weighted food web information, enabling a more complete assessment of the ecosystem structure and function of the Weddell Sea food web. Our results provide new insights, which are important for the development of effective policies and management strategies, particularly given the ongoing initiative to implement a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Weddell Sea.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In order to determine the impact generated by MPAs on effort distribution, 308 fishing trips carried out between 2010 and 2020, which reported 82\% of the total fishing effort of Argentine toothfish declared in that period, were spatially analyzed. The Y-MPA sector categorized as National Marine Reserve and located to the south of Tierra del Fuego reported more than half (58\%) of the toothfish catch recorded throughout that period, while the NBBII-MPA located to the east of Tierra del Fuego and south of De los Estados Island represented 17\%. The NBBII-MPA sector established as a Strict National Marine Reserve and located to the south of the Burdwood Bank represented 25\%. With the establishment of the MPAs, 7.11\% of the international requirement has been met. At the moment, effects resulting from the creation of MPAs can only be speculated upon qualitatively, but should be quantified in the near future.},

This review article aims to discriminate the dynamical processes controlling the interaction between this extensive shelf region and the deep-ocean. The discussion is focused on two broad regions: the South Brazil Bight to the north, and Patagonia to the south. The exchanges between the Brazil Current and the South Brazil Bight are characterized by the intermittent development of eddies and meanders of the Brazil Current at the shelfbreak. However, it is argued that this is not the only \textendash{} nor the most important \textendash{} influence of the Brazil Current on the shelf. Numerical simulations show that the thermohaline structure of the South Brazil Bight can be entirely ascribed to steady state, bottom boundary layer interactions between the shelf and the Brazil Current. The Malvinas Current does not show the development of eddies and meanders, but its influence on the Patagonian shelf is not less important. Models and observations indicate that the Malvinas Current not only controls the shelfbreak dynamics and cross-shelf exchanges but also influences the circulation in the shelf's interior.},

The time mean circulation is dominated by a cyclonic gyre bounded by a relatively strong coastal current and, on its offshore side, by the Patagonia Current. The gulf circulation varies significantly with season. Tidal mixing during the summer months generates baroclinic pressure gradients that allow development of a cyclonic gyre in the southern region. During winter, erosion of density gradients weakens the cyclonic tendency and a large anticyclonic gyre develops in the southern region. Atmospheric heat fluxes regulate the transition between summer and winter circulation patterns. Analysis of process-oriented experiments indicates that summer circulation is mainly driven by the interaction between tides and stratification while winter circulation is mainly driven by wind forcing. The mass exchanges between the gulf and the open shelf peak during the summer due to a larger onshore penetration of the Patagonia Current. During winter, these exchanges are very weak and remain largely confined to the northern portion of the gulf.}

Model analysis shows energetic upwelling and mixing uplifting deep and benthic waters into the photic layer. Tides and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current are the primary drivers of the bank's circulation. Tidal forcing is the main driver for the entrainment of deep waters into the upper layers of the bank and local wind forcing for the detrainment of these waters into the deep ocean. Passive tracer diagnostics suggest that the dynamical processes triggered by the Burdwood Bank could have a significant impact on local ecosystems and the biogeochemical balance of the southwestern Atlantic region, which is one of the most fertile portions of the Southern Ocean. Model results are robust\textemdash they are reproduced in a wide array of model configurations\textemdash but there is insufficient observational evidence to corroborate them. Satellite color imagery does not show substantial chlorophyll blooms in this region but it shows strong phytoplankton plumes emanating from the bank.

They have been applied to a wide range of ecological questions, including exploration of the implications of uncertainty about fundamental system structure. However, we argue that questions regarding model uncertainty in qualitative network analyses have been under-explored, and that there is a need for a coherent framework for evaluating uncertainty. To address this issue, we have developed a Bayesian framework for interpreting uncertainty that can be applied when comparing and evaluating the characteristics and behavior of alternative model formulations. Specifically, we recognize that results from previously developed simulation approaches to qualitative modeling can be interpreted as marginal likelihoods that translate to Bayes factors for model comparison. We then test and extend our Bayesian interpretation of qualitative model results to address comparisons both between and within alternative models. With the use of examples, we demonstrate how our Bayesian framework for interpretation can improve the application of qualitative modeling for addressing uncertainty about the structure and function of ecological networks.},

However, ecological and physiological attributes that favor dominance of these flagellates in the region have not been fully explored. The overall aim of this work was to characterize the phytoplankton pigments and assemblages in relation to environmental conditions during three successive summer cruises (2013, 2014 and 2015) in the Gerlache Strait - a coastal area in the northern WAP. Data on phytoplankton (through HPLC/CHEMTAX pigment analysis) and associated physical (water column structure) and chemical (macronutrients) parameters were determined. Cryptophytes were conspicuously found in shallow mixed layers, under stratified conditions, as the main contributors to total phytoplankton biomass. Their greatest contributions were associated with warmer surface waters at the northwestern sector of the strait. Other phytoplankton groups (Phaeocystis antarctica in 2013 and small diatoms in both 2014 and 2015) were also important components. Photoprotective carotenoids (mainly alloxanthin), with an important role in preventing photodamage caused by excess light, were closely linked with the dominance of cryptophytes at surface layers. The results of this study suggest that the prevalence of cryptophytes in WAP coastal waters can be, to a great extent, due to a particular ability of those small flagellates to successfully grow in highly illuminated conditions in shallow upper mixed layers and strong water column stratification.},

  abstract = {To determine the patterns of occurrence and importance of indirect effects relative to direct effects in natural communities, I analyzed experimentally based studies from 23 rocky intertidal habitats. The vehicle of analysis was the construction of interaction webs, or the subset of species in food webs involved in strong interactions. The analysis focused on indirect effects involving changes in abundance, or interaction chains, since little information was available on other types of indirect effects (behavioral, chemical response, environmental). As expected, number of direct (= strong) interactions, indirect effects, interaction sequences producing indirect effects, and types of indirect effects (e.g., keystone predation, apparent competition, etc.) all increased with web species richness. Less expected, when these measures were adjusted to a per species basis, positive relationships with species richness were still observed for all measures but the number of types. In other words, with increasing web diversity, each species interacted strongly with more species, was involved in more indirect effects, and was part of more interaction pathways. The analysis identified 83 subtypes of indirect effect, including the seven previously identified types. Many of the 76 additional types could be reclassified into the seven types if the original definitions of these 'classic' types were expanded to include interactions having similar effects but differing in the specific mechanism (e.g., both interference competition and inhibition of recruitment [preemption] have negative effects involving a spatial resource). Two new types of indirect effect, termed 'apparent predation' and 'indirect defense' were also identified, producing a total of 9 general types of indirect effect divided among 565 specific indirect effects. Of these, keystone predation (35\%) and apparent competition (25\%) were most common and exploitation competition (2.8\%) was least common in these webs. Two methods of analysis suggested that indirect effects accounted for \textdegree 40\% of the change in community structure resulting from manipulations, with a range of 24\textemdash 61\%. The proportion of change due to indirect effects was constant with web species richness, indicating that strong direct interactions and indirect effects produce roughly the same level of alteration of community structure regardless of the level of web complexity. Several potential artifacts and biases were evaluated. Most importantly, neither variation in level of taxonomic resolution nor intensity of experimentation varied significantly with web size (species richness). Despite a bias toward manipulation of consumers over manipulation of basal species, some predator\textemdash initiated indirect effect types were scarce while some basal species\textemdash initiated types were common. While the frequency of exploitation competition may have been underestimated, it is unlikely that the frequency of this indirect effect would change dramatically: changes due to this effect should have been detected in many of the studies and reported; and the most intensively studied individual webs did not report frequencies differing much from the average. This analysis suggests investigators effectively identified and first manipulated those species responsible for most indirect effects and that more experiments added decreasing numbers of indirect effects. Moreover, the frequencies and importance of indirect effects may be more predictable than expected on the basis of theory.},

  abstract = {Glacial meltwater discharge from Antarctica is a key influence on the marine environment, impacting ocean circulation, sea level and productivity of the pelagic and benthic ecosystems. The responses elicited depend strongly on the characteristics of the meltwater releases, including timing, spatial structure and geochemical composition. Here we use isotopic tracers to reveal the time-varying pattern of meltwater during a discharge event from the Fourcade Glacier into Potter Cove, northern Antarctic Peninsula. The discharge is strongly dependent on local air temperature, and accumulates into an extremely thin, buoyant layer at the surface. This layer showed evidence of elevated turbidity, and responded rapidly to changes in atmospherically driven circulation to generate a strongly pulsed outflow from the cove to the broader ocean. These characteristics contrast with those further south along the Peninsula, where strong glacial frontal ablation is driven oceanographically by intrusions of warm deep waters from offshore. The Fourcade Glacier switched very recently to being land-terminating; if retreat rates elsewhere along the Peninsula remain high and glacier termini progress strongly landward, the structure and impact of the freshwater discharges are likely to increasingly resemble the patterns elucidated here.

Observations from our winter cruise to the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean contradict this view and present the first evidence that the pack-ice zone is a food-poor habitat for larval development. In contrast, the more open marginal ice zone provides a more favourable food environment for high larval krill growth rates. We found that complex under-ice habitats are, however, vital for larval krill when water column productivity is limited by light, by providing structures that offer protection from predators and to collect organic material released from the ice. The larvae feed on this sparse ice-associated food during the day. After sunset, they migrate into the water below the ice (upper 20\,m) and drift away from the ice areas where they have previously fed. Model analyses indicate that this behaviour increases both food uptake in a patchy food environment and the likelihood of overwinter transport to areas where feeding conditions are more favourable in spring.},

  abstract = {In recent years, sea ice cover along coasts of East Antarctica has tended to increase. To understand ecological implications of these environmental changes, we studied benthic food web structure on the coasts of Ad\'elie Land during an event of unusually high sea ice cover (i.e. two successive austral summers without seasonal breakup). We used integrative trophic markers (stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur) to build ecological models and explored feeding habits of macroinvertebrates. In total, 28 taxa spanning most present animal groups and functional guilds were investigated. Our results indicate that the absence of seasonal sea ice breakup deeply influenced benthic food webs. Sympagic algae dominated the diet of many key consumers, and the trophic levels of invertebrates were low, suggesting omnivore consumers did not rely much on predation and/or scavenging. Our results provide insights about how Antarctic benthic consumers, which typically live in an extremely stable environment, might adapt their feeding habits in response to sudden changes in environmental conditions and trophic resource availability. They also show that local and/or global trends of sea ice increase in Antarctica have the potential to cause drastic changes in food web structure, and therefore to impact benthic communities.},

  abstract = {Antarctic marine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change and are considered to be particularly sensitive because of the adaptation of most organisms to cold and stable environmental conditions. Fishes play a central role in the Antarctic marine food web and might be affected by climate change in different ways: (i) directly by increasing water temperatures, decreasing seawater salinity and/or increasing concentrations of CO 2; (ii) indirectly by alterations in the food web, in particular by changes in prey composition, and (iii) by alterations and loss of habitat due to sea ice retreat and increased ice scouring on the sea floor. Based on new data and data collected from the literature, we analyzed the vulnerability of the fish community to these threats.The potential vulnerability and acting mechanisms differ among species, developmental stages and habitats. The icefishes (family Channichthyidae) are one group that are especially vulnerable to a changing South Polar Sea, as are the pelagic shoal fish species Pleuragramma antarcticum. Both will almost certainly be negatively affected by abiotic alterations and changes in food web structure associated with climate change, the latter additionally by habitat loss. The major bottleneck for the persistence of the majority of populations appears to be the survival of early developmental stages, which are apparently highly sensitive to many types of alterations. In the long term, if climate projections are realized, species loss seems inevitable: within the demersal fish community, the loss or decline of one species might be compensated by others, whereas the pelagic fish community in contrast is extremely poor in species and dominated by P. antarcticum. The loss of this key species could therefore have especially severe consequences for food web structure and the functioning of the entire ecosystem. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we explored the consequences of changes in species populations for the remaining species within nine exceptionally well-characterized empirical food webs, for which, unlike the vast majority of other published webs, feeding links have been fully quantified. Using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, we found that perturbations to species with few connections have larger net effects (considering both direct and indirect pathways between two species) on the rest of the food web than do disturbances to species that are highly connected. For 40\% of predator\textendash prey links, predators had positive net effects on prey populations, due to the predominance of indirect interactions. Our results highlight the fundamental, but often counterintuitive, role of indirect effects for the maintenance of food web complexity and biodiversity.},

Eight 2 m3 mesocosms were exposed to 4 treatments (with 2 replicates) during 10 d: (1) control (natural temperature and UVBR), (2) increased UVBR (simulating a 60\% decrease in stratospheric ozone layer thickness), (3) increased temperature (+ 3\textdegree C), and (4) simultaneous increased temperature and UVBR (60\% decrease in stratospheric ozone; + 3\textdegree C). Two distinct situations were observed with regard to phytoplankton biomass: bloom (Days 1-4) and post-bloom (Days 5-9). Significant decreases in micro-sized diatoms ({$>$}20 \textmu m), bacteria, chlorophyll a, and particulate organic carbon concentrations were observed during the post-bloom in the enhanced temperature treatments relative to natural temperature, accompanied by significant increases in nanophytoplankton (10-20 \textmu m, mainly prymnesiophytes). The decrease in micro-sized diatoms in the high temperature treatment may have been caused by a physiological effect of warming, although we do not have activity measurements to support this hypothesis. Prymnesiophytes benefited from micro-sized diatom reduction in their competition for resources. The bacterial decrease under warming may have been due to a change in the dissolved organic matter release caused by the observed change in phytoplankton composition. Overall, the rise in temperature affected the structure and total biomass of the communities, while no major effect of UVBR was observed on the plankton community.},

The eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and waters from the Weddell\textendash Scotia Confluence dominate the physics of the Scotia Sea, leading to a strong advective flow, intense eddy activity and mixing. There is also strong seasonality, manifest by the changing irradiance and sea ice cover, which leads to shorter summers in the south. Summer phytoplankton blooms, which at times can cover an area of more than 0.5 million km2, probably result from the mixing of micronutrients into surface waters through the flow of the ACC over the Scotia Arc. This production is consumed by a range of species including Antarctic krill, which are the major prey item of large seabird and marine mammal populations. The flow of the ACC is steered north by the Scotia Arc, pushing polar water to lower latitudes, carrying with it krill during spring and summer, which subsidize food webs around South Georgia and the northern Scotia Arc. There is also marked interannual variability in winter sea ice distribution and sea surface temperatures that is linked to southern hemisphere-scale climate processes such as the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation. This variation affects regional primary and secondary production and influences biogeochemical cycles. It also affects krill population dynamics and dispersal, which in turn impacts higher trophic level predator foraging, breeding performance and population dynamics. The ecosystem has also been highly perturbed as a result of harvesting over the last two centuries and significant ecological changes have also occurred in response to rapid regional warming during the second half of the twentieth century. This combination of historical perturbation and rapid regional change highlights that the Scotia Sea ecosystem is likely to show significant change over the next two to three decades, which may result in major ecological shifts.},

  abstract = {Determining how climate fluctuations affect ocean ecosystems requires an understanding of how biological and physical processes interact across a wide range of scales. Here we examine the role of physical and biological processes in generating fluctuations in the ecosystem around South Georgia in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST) in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean have previously been shown to be generated through atmospheric teleconnections with El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related processes. These SST anomalies are propagated via the Antarctic Circumpolar Current into the South Atlantic (on time scales of more than 1 year), where ENSO and Southern Annular Mode-related atmospheric processes have a direct influence on short (less than six months) time scales. We find that across the South Atlantic sector, these changes in SST, and related fluctuations in winter sea ice extent, affect the recruitment and dispersal of Antarctic krill. This oceanographically driven variation in krill population dynamics and abundance in turn affects the breeding success of seabird and marine mammal predators that depend on krill as food. Such propagating anomalies, mediated through physical and trophic interactions, are likely to be an important component of variation in ocean ecosystems and affect responses to longer term change. Population models derived on the basis of these oceanic fluctuations indicate that plausible rates of regional warming of 1oC over the next 100 years could lead to more than a 95\% reduction in the biomass and abundance of krill across the Scotia Sea by the end of the century.},

  abstract = {The ocean ecosystems around the west Antarctic Peninsula and South Georgia are two of the best described regional ecosystems of the Southern Ocean. They therefore provide a useful basis for developing comparative analyses of ocean ecosystems around the Antarctic. There are clear and expected differences in seasonality and species composition between the two ecosystems, but these mask an underlying similarity in ecosystem structure and function. This similarity results from the two ecosystems being part of a continuum, from more ice covered regions in the south to open water regions in the north. Within this continuum the major factors affecting ecosystem structure and function are the sea ice, the biogeochemical conditions and the connectivity generated by the flow of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Antarctic krill are central to the food web in both ecosystems, but the other species of plankton and predators present are different. These different species provide alternative pathways of energy transfer from primary production to the highest trophic levels. The relative dominance of these species can provide indicators of change in ecosystem structure and function. Both ecosystems are changing as a result of physically and biologically driven processes, and the ecological responses being observed are complex and variable across different species and within the two regions. Species in parts of the northern Antarctic Peninsula are being replaced by species that currently dominate farther north in more oceanic areas such as at South Georgia. The similarity of structure and strong connectivity, mean that projections of future change will require generic models of these ecosystems that can encompass changes in structure and function within a connected continuum from ice covered to open water in winter.},

Depth-averaged SPM dy\- namics during a meteorologically representative austral summer (120 days from December to March) considered tidal and atmospheric forcing. Additionally, idealised experiments with passive particles based on postprocessing Lagrangian module identified and followed possible material trajectories in Potter Cove. Particle dynamics in the area show them to be primarily tidal and wind-driven, sensitive to bathymetry, with the higher SPM concentrations in the inner cove and the highest hydrographical complexity in the transitional area between the fjordic and marine habitat. The SPM plume covers 5.5 km2 of the total inlet of 9 km2, with monthly mean values between 15 and 330 mg/l. The maximum SPM concentrations are during January (790 mg/l), and the maximum plume expansion during February. The model was validated with available in situ measurements. With this study, we can identify areas in Potter Cove (and similar coastal fjordic environments, prospectively) of increasing physical stress by longer SPM residence time and high accumulation rates induced by glacial melt\- water. These factors are crucial for pelagic and benthic assemblages dependent on light and food availability, as well sediment deposition.},

  abstract = {Interaction strength (IS) has been theoretically shown to play a major role in governing the stability and dynamics of food webs. Nonetheless, its definition has been varied and problematic, including a range of recent definitions based on biological rates associated with model parameters (e.g., attack rate). Results from food web theory have been used to argue that IS metrics based on energy flux ought to have a clear relationship with stability. Here, we use simple models to elucidate the actual relationship between local stability and a number of common IS metrics (total flux and per capita fluxes) as well as a more recently suggested metric. We find that the classical IS metrics map to stability in a more complex way than suggested by existing food web theory and that the new IS metric has a much clearer, and biologically interpretable, relationship with local stability. The total energy flux metric falls off existing theoretical predictions when the total resource productivity available to the consumer is reduced despite increased consumer attack rates. The density of a consumer can hence decrease when its attack rate increases. This effect, called the paradox of attack rate, is similar to the well-known hydra effect and can even cascade up a food chain to exclude a predator when consumer attack rate is increased.},

Across all biological groups analysed, higher explanatory power of the stress-effect models was discernible for lakes under multi-stressor compared to single stressor conditions, but generally lower for coastal and transitional waters. Across all aquatic environments, the explanatory power of stress-effect models for fish increased when multi-stressor conditions were taken into account in the analysis, qualifying this organism group as a useful indicator of multi-stress effects. In contrast, the explanatory power of models using benthic flora decreased under conditions of multiple stress.},

While DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used for dietary studies, methodological biases have limited its application for food web modeling. Here, we used data from dietary metabarcoding studies of zooplankton to calculate prey selectivity indices and assess energy fluxes in a pelagic resource-consumer network. We show that food web dynamics are influenced by prey selectivity and temporal match-mismatch in growth cycles and that cyanobacteria are the main source of primary production in the investigated coastal pelagic food web. The latter challenges the common assumption that cyanobacteria are not supporting food web productivity, a result that is increasingly relevant as global warming promotes cyanobacteria dominance. While this study provides a method for how DNA metabarcoding can be used to quantify energy fluxes in a marine food web, the approach presented here can easily be extended to other ecosystems.},

Complex ecological networks are characterized by distributions of interaction strengths that are highly skewed, with many weak and few strong interactors present. Theory suggests that this pattern promotes stability as weak interactors dampen the destabilizing potential of strong interactors. Here, we present an experimental test of this hypothesis and provide empirical evidence that the loss of weak interactors can destabilize communities in nature. We ranked 10 marine consumer species by the strength of their trophic interactions. We removed the strongest and weakest of these interactors from experimental food webs containing {$>$}100 species. Extinction of strong interactors produced a dramatic trophic cascade and reduced the temporal stability of key ecosystem process rates, community diversity and resistance to changes in community composition. Loss of weak interactors also proved damaging for our experimental ecosystems, leading to reductions in the temporal and spatial stability of ecosystem process rates, community diversity, and resistance. These results highlight the importance of conserving species to maintain the stabilizing pattern of trophic interactions in nature, even if they are perceived to have weak effects in the system.},

Development and exploitation mean that they are faced with stresses from a number of anthropogenic sources. Such stresses are typically studied in isolation, but multiple stressors can combine in unexpected ways to alter the structure of ecological systems. Here, we experimentally explore the impacts of inorganic nutrients and organic matter on a range of food web properties. We find that these two stressors combine additively to produce significant increases in connectance and mean food chain length. Such increases are typically associated with enhanced robustness to secondary extinctions and productivity, respectively. Despite these apparent beneficial effects, we find a simplification of web structure in terms of taxon richness and diversity, and altered proportions of basal and top species. These effects are driven by a reduction in community assembly and lower consistency in a range of system properties as a result of the multiple stressors. Consequently, impacted food webs are likely to be more vulnerable to human- or climate-induced perturbations in the long term.},

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the presence of MPs in Nacella magellanica among sites of the Beagle Channel with different degree of anthropogenic influence. Intertidal limpets were sampled in three sites: Ushuaia Bay (UB) (inside Ushuaia city), a site with high anthropogenic influence owing to population growth, and fisheries, industrial and port activities; Ensenada Zaratiegui (EZ) and Playa Larga (PL) (west and east of Ushuaia city, respectively), both sites with a certain degree of environmental protection and low anthropogenic influence. MPs were isolated from the whole soft tissue of individuals by oxidative digestions with H2O2 (30\%; 1:10 w/v). MPs occurrence was 100\% in organisms from UB and EZ, whereas 90\% in PL. Limpets from UB showed 10 {$\pm$} 6.69 MPs/ind and 2.22 {$\pm$} 0.78 MPs/g ww, while in PL and EZ there were 2.90 {$\pm$} 2.02 MPs/ind and 0.96 {$\pm$} 0.94 MPs/g ww; and 5.60 {$\pm$} 2.59 MPs/ind and 2.41 {$\pm$} 1.47 MPs/g ww, respectively. Fibres were the most abundant MPs type, followed by fragments and films. Fibres and films were identified as semi-synthetic cellulose and, although the polymer matrix of fragments was masked by copper phthalocyanine, one of them could be identified as polystyrene. As expected, the highest abundance of MPs was found in UB. However, a lower abundance of particles was detected in PL (downstream of UB) than in EZ (upstream of UB). This could be due to the influence of both the main current of the Beagle Channel and fluvial discharges, reducing the buoyancy of MPs. More studies are needed to understand the contribution of regional and local features to the accumulation of MPs in these environments and their interaction with the biota.},

Using a range of ocean temperature data including global records of daily satellite observations, daily in situ measurements and gridded monthly in situ-based data sets, we identify significant increases in marine heatwaves over the past century. We find that from 1925 to 2016, global average marine heatwave frequency and duration increased by 34\% and 17\%, respectively, resulting in a 54\% increase in annual marine heatwave days globally.

  abstract = {Ecological communities are constantly being reshaped in the face of environmental change and anthropogenic pressures. Yet, how food webs change over time remains poorly understood. Food web science is characterized by a trade-off between complexity (in terms of the number of species and feeding links) and dynamics. Topological analysis can use complex, highly resolved empirical food web models to explore the architecture of feeding interactions but is limited to a static view, whereas ecosystem models can be dynamic but use highly aggregated food webs. Here, we explore the temporal dynamics of a highly resolved empirical food web over a time period of 18 years, using the German Bight fish and benthic epifauna community as our case study. We relied on long-term monitoring ecosystem surveys (from 1998 to 2015) to build a metaweb, i.e. the meta food web containing all species recorded over the time span of our study. We then combined time series of species abundances with topological network analysis to construct annual food web snapshots. We developed a new approach, `node-weighted' food web metrics by including species abundances to represent the temporal dynamics of food web structure, focusing on generality and vulnerability. Our results suggest that structural food web properties change through time; however, binary food web structural properties may not be as temporally variable as the underlying changes in species composition. Further, the node-weighted metrics enabled us to detect that food web structure was influenced by changes in species composition during the first half of the time series and more strongly by changes in species dominance during the second half. Our results demonstrate how ecosystem surveys can be used to monitor temporal changes in food web structure, which are important ecosystem indicators for building marine management and conservation plans.},

Species distribution and its relationship with ice cover were analyzed statistically. The ice cover concentration was estimated by using satellite images. We compared our results with the first ship-based bird survey conducted up to the Filchner Ice Shelf in the austral summer 1955/56 to analyze possible changes in the bird community over time. Out of 13 recorded species in the 1955/56 cruise, 11 were present in this study with similar abundance proportions. In both cruises, the bird community consisted of a group of non-numerous species associated with icefree waters and another group of very numerous species associated with high concentrations on ice cover. The similarities between the two cruises, spaced 65 years apart, suggest a temporal persistence of the bird community of the central and the southern Weddell Sea that could be explained by the dynamics of the ice cover and the presence of reproductive colonies within the study site. The current environmental warming is alarming in this bird community because more than 85\% of all its individuals belong to four species strongly dependent on ice cover.},

Multiple-stressor research is a rapidly expanding field of science that seeks to understand and ultimately predict the interactions between stressors.

In this cross-disciplinary study, we review the state of knowledge within and among these disciplines to highlight commonality and division in multiple-stressor research. Our review goes beyond a description of previous research by using quantitative bibliometric analysis to identify the division between disciplines and link previously disconnected research communities. Towards a unified research framework, we discuss the shared goal of increased realism through both ecological and temporal complexity, with the overarching aim of improving predictive power. In a rapidly changing world, advancing our understanding of the cumulative ecological impacts of multiple stressors is critical for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management. Identifying and overcoming the barriers to interdisciplinary knowledge exchange is necessary in rising to this challenge. Division between ecosystem types and disciplines is largely a human creation.

  abstract = {The krill surplus hypothesis of unlimited prey resources available for Antarctic predators due to commercial whaling in the 20th century has remained largely untested since the 1970s. Rapid warming of the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) over the past 50 years has resulted in decreased seasonal ice cover and a reduction of krill. The latter is being exacerbated by a commercial krill fishery in the region. Despite this, humpback whale populations have increased but may be at a threshold for growth based on these human-induced changes. Understanding how climate-mediated variation in prey availability influences humpback whale population dynamics is critical for focused management and conservation actions. Using an 8-year dataset (2013\textendash 2020), we show that inter-annual humpback whale pregnancy rates, as determined from skin-blubber biopsy samples (n = 616), are positively correlated with krill availability and fluctuations in ice cover in the previous year. Pregnancy rates showed significant inter-annual variability, between 29\% and 86\%. Our results indicate that krill availability is in fact limiting and affecting reproductive rates, in contrast to the krill surplus hypothesis. This suggests that this population of humpback whales may be at a threshold for population growth due to prey limitations. As a result, continued warming and increased fishing along the WAP, which continue to reduce krill stocks, will likely impact this humpback whale population and other krill predators in the region. Humpback whales are sentinel species of ecosystem health, and changes in pregnancy rates can provide quantifiable signals of the impact of environmental change at the population level. Our findings must be considered paramount in developing new and more restrictive conservation and management plans for the Antarctic marine ecosystem and minimizing the negative impacts of human activities in the region.},

  abstract = {In order to assess the relevance of sporadic upwelling events on primary productivity, the availability of nitrogen (N) sources and their uptake by phytoplankton were studied. Incubations of 15N-enriched samples were performed at 3 depths in 12 stations in San Jorge Gulf (SJG, Patagonia Argentina) aboard of the R/V ``Puerto Deseado'' during November 2016. Additional coastal stations were sampled to analyze the upwelling event. The total uptake of N sources ({$\rho$}NO3-~+~{$\rho$}NH4+) was higher on the surface than in the deep layer. The {$\rho$}NO3- by phytoplankton doubled that of {$\rho$}NH4+ suggesting SJG acted as a CO2 sink during the period studied. However, NH4+ played an important role in maintaining primary productivity where NO3- was low. In most stations, phytoplankton showed a preference for the uptake of the less available N source, likely resulting from adaptation to low nutrient concentrations. However, in the southwestern sector of the gulf, where a wind-induced upwelling occurred, phytoplankton preferred to uptake NO3-, this being the most abundant N source. As a consequence, the integrated primary productivity in the water column of that sector was high. Results suggest that such high productivity was governed by the optimal relationship between the preference and availability of N, established by the presence of elevated NO3- and low NH4+ ambient concentration. This would be a physiological process regardless of community composition. The new primary productivity generated by upwelling events could be key to feeding the biological resources of the gulf.},

  abstract = {The western Antarctic Peninsula is experiencing strong environmental changes as a consequence of ongoing regional warming. Glaciers in the area are retreating rapidly and increased sediment-laden meltwater runoff threatens the benthic biodiversity at shallow depths. We identified three sites with a distinct glacier-retreat related history and different levels of glacial influence in the inner part of Potter Cove (King George Island, South Shetland Islands), a fjord-like embayment impacted since the 1950s by a tidewater glacier retreat. We compared the soft sediment meio- and macrofauna isotopic niche widths ({$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N stable isotope analysis) at the three sites to investigate possible glacier retreat-related influences on benthic trophic interactions. The isotopic niches were locally shaped by the different degrees of glacier retreat-related disturbance within the Cove. Wider isotopic niche widths were found at the site that has become ice-free most recently, and narrower niches at the older ice-free sites. At an intermediate state of glacier retreat-related disturbance (e.g. via ice-growler scouring) species with different strategies could settle. The site at the earliest stage of post-retreat development was characterized by an assemblage with lower trophic redundancy. Generally, the isotopic niche widths increased with increasing size spectra of organisms within the community, excepting the youngest assemblage, where the pioneer colonizer meiofauna size class displayed the highest isotopic niche width. Meiofauna at all sites generally occupied positions in the isotopic space that suggested a detrital-pool food source and/or the presence of predatory taxa. In general ice scour and glacial impact appeared to play a two-fold role within the Cove: i) either stimulating trophic diversity by allowing continuous re-colonization of meiofaunal species or, ii) over time driving the benthic assemblages into a more compact trophic structure with increased connectedness and resource recycling.},

  abstract = {The West Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming regions on Earth. Faster glacier retreat and related calving events lead to more frequent iceberg scouring, fresh water input and higher sediment loads, which in turn affect shallow water benthic marine assemblages in coastal regions. In addition, ice retreat creates new benthic substrates for colonization. We investigated three size classes of benthic biota (microbenthos, meiofauna and macrofauna) at three sites in Potter Cove (King George Island, West Antarctic Peninsula) situated at similar water depths but experiencing different disturbance regimes related to glacier retreat. Our results revealed the presence of a patchy distribution of highly divergent benthic assemblages within a relatively small area (about 1 km2). In areas with frequent ice scouring and higher sediment accumulation rates, an assemblage mainly dominated by macrobenthic scavengers (such as the polychaete Barrukia cristata), vagile organisms and younger individuals of sessile species (such as the bivalve Yoldia eightsi) was found. Macrofauna were low in abundance and very patchily distributed in recently ice-free areas close to the glacier, whereas the pioneer nematode genus Microlaimus reached a higher relative abundance in these newly exposed sites. The most diverse and abundant macrofaunal assemblage was found in areas most remote from recent glacier influence. By contrast, the meiofauna showed relatively low densities in these areas. The three benthic size classes appeared to respond in different ways to disturbances likely related to ice retreat, suggesting that the capacity to adapt and colonize habitats is dependent on both body size and specific life traits. We predict that, under continued deglaciation, more diverse, but less patchy, benthic assemblages will become established in areas out of reach of glacier-related disturbance.},

Results showed that M. schmitti is a mesocarnivorous with a mean trophic level of 3.58. The diet was based mostly on crustaceans (decapods, stomatopods, isopods and amphipods), polychaetes, fishes and cephalopods, in a decreasing order of importance. The diet varied between juveniles and adults, and between individuals captured by the trawling fishery and sport anglers. Crabs were the main prey item observed in the stomach of individuals caught by anglers while the shrimp Pleoticus muelleri was the most consumed prey by individuals caught as by-catch. Juveniles consumed more polychaetes than adults, while the latter consumed mostly shrimp. The presence of shrimp in stomach contents of M. schmitti caught by the commercial fishery is evidence of a trophic interaction between M. schmitti and the fishery. The interaction may be due to the shark and the fleet targeting the same resource, or due to the shark using the discarded shrimp as a food source.},

Salps produce 4-fold more FP carbon than krill, but the FP from both species contribute equally to the carbon flux at 300\,m, accounting for 75\% of total carbon. Krill FP are exported to 72\% to 300\,m, while 80\% of salp FP are retained in the mixed layer due to fragmentation. Thus, declining krill abundances could lead to decreased carbon flux, indicating that the Antarctic Peninsula could become a less efficient carbon sink for anthropogenic CO2 in future.},

  abstract = {Animals living in the Southern Ocean have evolved in a singular environment. It shares many of its attributes with the high Arctic, namely low, stable temperatures, the pervading effect of ice in its many forms and extreme seasonality of light and phytobiont productivity. Antarctica is, however, the most isolated continent on Earth and is the only one that lacks a continental shelf connection with another continent. This isolation, along with the many millions of years that these conditions have existed, has produced a fauna that is both diverse, with around 17,000 marine invertebrate species living there, and has the highest proportions of endemic species of any continent. The reasons for this are discussed. The isolation, history and unusual environmental conditions have resulted in the fauna producing a range and scale of adaptations to low temperature and seasonality that are unique. The best known such adaptations include channichthyid icefish that lack haemoglobin and transport oxygen around their bodies only in solution, or the absence, in some species, of what was only 20 years ago termed the universal heat shock response. Other adaptations include large size in some groups, a tendency to produce larger eggs than species at lower latitudes and very long gametogenic cycles, with egg development (vitellogenesis) taking 18\textendash 24 months in some species. The rates at which some cellular and physiological processes are conducted appear adapted to, or at least partially compensated for, low temperature such as microtubule assembly in cells, whereas other processes such as locomotion and metabolic rate are not compensated, and whole-animal growth, embryonic development, and limb regeneration in echinoderms proceed at rates even slower than would be predicted by the normal rules governing the effect of temperature on biological processes. This review describes the current state of knowledge on the biodiversity of the Southern Ocean fauna and on the majority of known ecophysiological adaptations of cold-blooded marine species to Antarctic conditions. It further evaluates the impacts these adaptations have on capacities to resist, or respond to change in the environment, where resistance to raised temperatures seems poor, whereas exposure to acidified conditions to end-century levels has comparatively little impact.},

  abstract = {Large-scale alterations in marine ecosystems as a response to environmental and anthropogenic pressures have been documented worldwide. Yet, these are primarily investigated by assessing abundance fluctuations of a few dominant species, which inadequately reflect ecosystem-wide changes. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that it is not species identity per se, but their traits that determine environmental responses, biological interactions and ecosystem functioning. In this study, we investigated long-term, spatio-temporal variability in trait composition across multiple organism groups to assess whether functional changes occur in a similar way across trophic levels and whether shifts in trait composition link to environmental change. We combined extensive trait datasets with long-term surveys (30\textendash 40 yr) of four organism groups (phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates and fish) in three environmentally distinct areas of a large marine ecosystem. We found similar temporal trajectories in the community weighted mean trait time-series of the different trophic groups, revealing ecosystem-wide functional changes. The traits involved and their dynamics differed between areas, concurrent with climate-driven changes in temperature and salinity, as well as more local dynamics in nutrients and oxygen. This finding highlights the importance of considering both global climate, as well as local external drivers when studying ecosystem changes. Using a multi-trophic trait-based approach, our study demonstrates the importance of integrating community functional dynamics across multiple trophic levels to capture ecosystem-wide responses which could, ultimately, help moving towards a holistic understanding, assessment and management of marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Species are redistributing globally in response to climate warming, impacting ecosystem functions and services. In the Barents Sea, poleward expansion of boreal species and a decreased abundance of Arctic species are causing a rapid borealization of the Arctic communities. This borealization might have profound consequences on the Arctic food web by creating novel feeding interactions between previously non co-occurring species. An early identification of new feeding links is crucial to predict their ecological impact. However, detection by traditional approaches, including stomach content and isotope analyses, although fundamental, cannot cope with the speed of change observed in the region, nor with the urgency of understanding the consequences of species redistribution for the marine ecosystem. In this study, we used an extensive food web (metaweb) with nearly 2,500 documented feeding links between 239 taxa coupled with a trait data set to predict novel feeding interactions and to quantify their potential impact on Arctic food web structure. We found that feeding interactions are largely determined by the body size of interacting species, although species foraging habitat and metabolic type are also important predictors. Further, we found that all boreal species will have at least one potential resource in the Arctic region should they redistribute therein. During 2014\textendash 2017, 11 boreal species were observed in the Arctic region of the Barents Sea. These incoming species, which are all generalists, change the structural properties of the Arctic food web by increasing connectance and decreasing modularity. In addition, these boreal species are predicted to initiate novel feeding interactions with the Arctic residents, which might amplify their impact on Arctic food web structure affecting ecosystem functioning and vulnerability. Under the ongoing species redistribution caused by environmental change, we propose merging a trait-based approach with ecological network analysis to efficiently predict the impacts of range-shifting species on food webs.},

Location Barents Sea. Method We analysed data of benthic and bentho-pelagic fish and megabenthic invertebrates caught in the Barents Sea ecosystem survey in August\textendash September 2009\textendash 2017 to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of bentho-demersal communities and food webs. We used a trait dataset and highly resolved bentho-demersal food web to calculate community and food web metrics in space and time. We spatially clustered the community and food web based on their properties using archetypal analysis and investigated their co-variation with environmental and fishing pressure using (hierarchical) redundancy analysis. Result The community and food web metrics partitioned the Barents Sea into four sub-regions where different pressures act on the bentho-demersal fauna, such as sea ice loss and fisheries. Multiple community metrics (e.g. mean body length and trophic level) varied along an environmental gradient of annual mean sea bottom temperature, trawling intensity and ice-cover, whereas multiple food web metrics (e.g. nestedness and connectance) varied along an environmental gradient of depth and sediment composition. Communities had higher biomass-weighted variability in body size and omnivory values in areas where the Atlantic and Arctic water masses mix. Several food web and community metrics co-varied (e.g. food chain length and mean trophic level). We found no clear temporal trends in the ecological metrics in any of the four sub-regions, but the metrics had large inter-annual variability with some local minima or maxima coinciding with high sea temperature and ice-cover anomalies. Conclusion Analyses at the community and food web level are seldom integrated in ecological studies, while this integration gives complementary information to assess patterns and drivers of ecosystem state and to better prioritize conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {Antarctic krill inhabit areas of the Southern Ocean that can exceed 4.0\textdegree C, yet they preferentially inhabit regions with temperatures of -1.5 to {$\leq$}1.5\textdegree C. Successful embryonic development and hatching are key to their life cycle, but despite the rapid climatic warming seen across their main spawning areas, the effects of elevated temperatures on embryogenesis, hatching success, and nauplii malformations are unknown. We incubated 24,483 krill embryos in two independent experiments to investigate the hypothesis that temperatures exceeding 1.5\textdegree C have a negative impact on hatching success and increase the numbers of malformed nauplii. Field experiments were on krill collected from near the northern, warm limit of their range and embryos incubated soon after capture, while laboratory experiments were on embryos from krill acclimated to laboratory conditions. The hatching success of embryo batches varied enormously, from 0 to 98\% (mean 27\%). Both field and laboratory experiments showed that hatching success decreased markedly above 3.0\textdegree C. Our field experiments also showed an approximate doubling of the percentage of malformed nauplii at elevated temperatures, reaching 50\% at 5.0\textdegree C. At 3.0\textdegree C or below, however, temperature was not the main factor driving the large variation in embryo hatching success. Our observations of highly variable and often low success of hatching to healthy nauplii suggest that indices of reproductive potential of female krill relate poorly to the subsequent production of viable krill larvae and may help to explain spatial discrepancies between the distribution of the spawning stock and larval distribution.},

  abstract = {Following the oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1989, effects were observed across a wide range of habitats and species. The data allow us to evaluate direct and indirect links between shoreline habitats and the coastal ecosystem in general. The intertidal zone sufferred from direct oiling and clean-up treatments such as pressurized hot water, resulting in freeing of bare space on rocks and reductions in fucoid algal cover. Grazing limpets, periwinkles, mussels and barnacles were killed or removed. Subsequent indirect effects included colonization of the upper shore by ephemeral algae and an opportunistic barnacle and, in some regions, spread of Fucus gardneri into the lower shore where it inhibited return of red algae. The loss of habitat provided by the Fucus canopy slowed recovery on high shores, and lowered abundance of associated invertebrates. Abundance of sediment infauna declined and densities of clams were reduced directly. Their recovery was still incomplete by 1997 on oiled and treated shores where fine sediments had been washed down slope during treatment. Impacts in subtidal habitats were less intense than in the intertidal zone. Kelps were reduced in 1989 but recovered rapidly through re-colonization by 1990. Abundances of a dominant crab and seastar were reduced greatly, with recovery of the more mobile species, the crab, occurring by 1991. For about 4 years, there was reduced eelgrass density and hence less habitat for associated animals. Abundance of several toxin-sensitive amphipods declined dramatically and had not recovered by 1995. In general, how ever, many subtidal infaunal invertebrates increased in abundance, especially oligochaetes and surface deposit-feeding polychaetes. This may have resulted from increases in sediment hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, but may also reflect reduction of predators. Along northern Knight Island, where sea otter populations had not recovered by 1997, green sea-urchins were larger, compared with those in un-oiled parts of Montague Island. This initial response from reduced predation by sea otters, if sustained, could lead to additional indirect effects of the spill. Scavenging terrstrial birds, such as bald eagles and northwestern crows, sufferred direct mortality as adults and reproductive losses, although eagles recovered rapidly. Numbers of intertidal benthic fishes were 40\% lower on oiled than on un-oiled shores in 1990, but recovery was underway by 1991. Small benthic fishes living in eelgrass showed sensitivity to hydrocarbon contamination until at least 1996, as evidenced by hemosiderosis in liver tissues and P450 1A enzyme induction. Oiling of intertidal spawning habitats affected breeding of herring and pink salmon. Pink salmon, and possibly Dolly Varden char and cut-throat trout, showed slower growth when foraging on oiled shorelines as older juveniles and adults, which for pink salmon implies lower survival. The pigeon guillemots that suffered from the oil spill showed reduced feeding on sand eels and capelin, which may also have been affected by the spill, and this may have contributed to failure of guillemot recovery. There was an analogous failure of harbor seals to recover. Sea otters declined by approximately 50\%, and juvenile survival was depressed on oiled shores for at least four winters. Both black oystercatchers, shorebirds that feed on intertidal invertebrates, and also harlequin ducks showed reduced abundance on oiled shores that persisted for years after the spill. Oystercatchers consumed oiled mussels from beds where contamination by only partially weathered oil persisted until at least 1994, with a resulting impact on productivity of chicks. A high over-winter mortality of adult harlequin ducks continued in 1995\textendash 1996, 1996\textendash 1997 and 1997\textendash 1998. Delays in the recovery of avian and mammalian predators of fishes and invertebrates through chronic and indirect effects occurred long after the iniatial impacts of the spill. Such delayed effects are not usually incorporated into ecotoxicity risk assessments which thus substantially understimate impacts of a spill. Detection of delayed impacts requires rigorous long-term field sampling, so as to observe the dynamics of recovery processes.},

  abstract = {Due to extreme pack ice, the Filchner Region in the southern Weddell Sea is one of the least studied regions on the planet. Here, we provide a detailed description of the benthic communities of this high-Antarctic ecosystem, and assess the relationship between environmental factors and benthic distribution patterns. Fieldwork was performed in the austral summers of 2013-14 and 2015-16 during the R/V `Polarstern' cruises PS82 and PS96. Using a combination of multibox corer (MBC) and seabed image data from 37 stations (water depths 243-1217 m), we differentiated 6 station groups. While 1 of these groups was comprised of a single station, the other 5 groups represented distinct benthic communities. Three of these correspond to the previously described Eastern Shelf, Southern Shelf, and Southern Trench communities. However, we found distribution shifts and MBC abundance and biomass reductions when comparing our results with earlier studies. The other 2 groups have novel characteristics and are presented here as an Ice/Ice Shelf Water-related community and a Continental slope community. Water depth in combination with 2 or 3 other environmental variables (out of 7 available) explained {$<$}30\% of the benthic distribution and composition. We found a tighter relationship between water mass circulation and spatial distribution of the communities; we suggest using water-mass-related characteristics (e.g. productivity regimes, water currents) to better explain benthic spatial distribution patterns.},

Concomitant increases in sea-ice cover suggest a reduced flux of primary production to the benthos. As benthic communities are major repositories for Antarctic biodiversity and play an important role in biogeochemical cycling, the observed changes have far-reaching consequences for the Antarctic ecosystem and its feedback to the climate system. The findings underscore the importance of long-term ecological monitoring in a region vulnerable to warming and ice-shelf collapse.},

  abstract = {Within the framework of the Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean (MEASO), this paper brings together analyses of recent trends in phytoplankton biomass, primary production and irradiance at the base of the mixed layer in the Southern Ocean and summarises future projections. Satellite observations suggest that phytoplankton biomass in the mixed-layer has increased over the last 20 years in most (but not all) parts of the Southern Ocean, whereas primary production at the base of the mixed-layer has likely decreased over the same period. Different satellite models of primary production (Vertically Generalised versus Carbon Based Production Models) give different patterns and directions of recent change in net primary production (NPP). At present, the satellite record is not long enough to distinguish between trends and climate-related cycles in primary production. Over the next 100 years, Earth system models project increasing NPP in the water column in the MEASO northern and Antarctic zones but decreases in the Subantarctic zone. Low confidence in these projections arises from: (1) the difficulty in mapping supply mechanisms for key nutrients (silicate, iron); and (2) understanding the effects of multiple stressors (including irradiance, nutrients, temperature, pCO2, pH, grazing) on different species of Antarctic phytoplankton. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, there are likely to be changes to the seasonal patterns of production and the microbial community present over the next 50\textendash 100 years and these changes will have ecological consequences across Southern Ocean food-webs, especially on key species such as Antarctic krill and silverfish.}

We find that by the year 2100 localized regions along the western Weddell Sea, isolated areas of the Indian Antarctic , and the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea will support successful spawning habitats for krill. The failure of potentially successful spawning will have a strong impact on the already declining adult populations with consequences for the Antarctic marine food web, having both ecological and commercial ramifications.},

In this paper, we evaluate the conditions for the development of coastal upwelling in the San Jorge Gulf, on the west coast of the South Atlantic Ocean. The wind-based upwelling indices were calculated for 4 years (2003\textendash 2006) in three coastal regions of the gulf with different orientations. Monthly images of sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and wind and numerical simulations were used to analyze upwelling conditions. In addition, results of daily images, numerical simulations with daily forcings and CTD sections in the southwestern region of the gulf during the spring of 2016 and 2017 were described. The upwelling indices clearly highlight the differences between the three regions, linked to the basin geometry. Using an average of daily indices in the southwestern part of the gulf, thirteen upwelling events were detected during the warm season (November to March, 2003\textendash 2006). Numerical simulations suggest that the drop in surface temperature generated by an upwelling event in the SW region remains cold for more than a week. The wind pattern and CTD profiles during spring 2016 suggested favorable conditions for coastal upwelling compared to the profiles performed in 2017, in which wind do not appear to be upwelling-favorable.},

Recent evidence highlighted that, after pulse disturbance, the functioning a community performs may be recovered fast due to functional redundancy, whereas community multivariate composition needs a longer time. Yet, the mechanisms that drive the different community recovery times have not been quantified empirically. We use quantitative food-web analysis to assess the influence of species interactions on community recovery. We found species-interactions strength to be the main mechanism driving differences between structural and functional recovery. Additionally, we show that interactions between multiple disturbances appear in the long term only when both species-interaction strength and food-web architecture change significantly.           ,              Ecological communities are constantly exposed to multiple natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Multivariate composition (if recovered) has been found to need significantly more time to be regained after pulsed disturbance compared to univariate diversity metrics and functional endpoints. However, the mechanisms driving the different recovery times of communities to single and multiple disturbances remain unexplored. Here, we apply quantitative ecological network analyses to try to elucidate the mechanisms driving long-term community-composition dissimilarity and late-stage disturbance interactions at the community level. For this, we evaluate the effects of two pesticides, nutrient enrichment, and their interactions in outdoor mesocosms containing a complex freshwater community. We found changes in interactions strength to be strongly related to compositional changes and identified postdisturbance interaction-strength rewiring to be responsible for most of the observed compositional changes. Additionally, we found pesticide interactions to be significant in the long term only when both interaction strength and food-web architecture are reshaped by the disturbances. We suggest that quantitative network analysis has the potential to unveil ecological processes that prevent long-term community recovery.},

The monthly biomass production was calculated for each species by difference between the expected biomass and the observed biomass at the previous month.

  abstract = {Climate warming has been related to glacial retreat along the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Over the last years, a visible melting of Fourcade Glacier (Potter Cove, South Shetland Islands) has exposed newly ice-free hard bottom areas available for benthic colonization. However, ice melting produces a reduction of light penetration due to an increase of sediment input and higher ice impact. Seventeen years ago, the coastal sites close to the glacier cliffs were devoid of macroalgae. Are the newly ice-free areas suitable for macroalgal colonization? To tackle this question, underwater video transects were performed at six newly ice-free areas with different degree of glacial influence. Macroalgae were found in all sites, even in close proximity to the retreating glacier. We can show that: 1. The complexity of the macroalgal community is positively correlated to the elapsed time from the ice retreat, 2. Algae development depends on the optical conditions and the sediment input in the water column; some species are limited by light availability, 3. Macroalgal colonization is negatively affected by the ice disturbance, 4. The colonization is determined by the size and type of substrate and by the slope of the bottom. As macroalgae are probably one of the main energy sources for the benthos, an expansion of the macroalgal distribution can be expected to affect the matter and energy fluxes in Potter Cove ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Basic ecological knowledge regarding the importance of different sources of primary production and how it is transferred among consumer species is required to properly manage and conserve subpolar ecosystems that are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes. We used carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) stable isotope analysis to establish a baseline of species interactions and food web structure for the nearshore marine community in Bahia Lapataia, Argentina, an ecosystem that faces many threats, including a recent invasion of exotic chinook salmon. Primary producers and other organic sources (e.g., particulate organic matter) available to the food web were isotopically distinct and had a wide range in {$\delta$}13C (-31.3 to -5.3~\textperthousand ) and {$\delta$}15N (-0.5 to 13.1~\textperthousand ) values. Consumers also showed a wide range of isotope values with mean {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values ranging from -20.8 to -12.3~\textperthousand{} and from 10.5 to 19.6~\textperthousand, respectively. A cluster analysis of these isotope data correctly identified functional groups and expected interactions among species based on independent information. Using Bayesian isotope mixing models, we estimated that the proportional contribution of benthic production, in particular through grazing and the consumption of detritus, was a more important source of energy for primary and secondary consumers than pelagic production. Using stable isotope analysis to continually monitor species interactions and food web structure may prove to be a valuable research and management tool for assessing ecological consequences of different threats in this and other subpolar ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Understanding the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems has become a critical issue to assess the potential short- and long-term effects of natural and anthropogenic impacts and to determine the knowledge needed to conduct appropriate conservation actions. This goal can be achieved in part by acquiring more detailed food web information and evaluating the processes that shape food web structure and dynamics. Our main objective was to identify large-scale patterns in the organization of pelagic food webs that can be linked to a wasp-waist (WW) structure, proposed for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean. We evaluated 3 sub-Antarctic marine areas in a regional context: the Beagle Channel (BC), the Atlantic coast of Tierra del Fuego (CA) and the oceanic Burdwood Bank area (BB). We used carbon and nitrogen isotopic information of all functional trophic groups, ranging from primary producers to top predators, and analyzed them through stable isotope-based Bayesian analyses. We found that BC and BB have a more pronounced WW structure compared to CA. We identified species at mid to low trophic positions that play a key role in the trophodynamics of each marine area (e.g. Fuegian sprat Sprattus fuegensis, longtail southern cod Patagonotothen ramsayi and squat lobster Munida gregaria) and considered them as the most plausible WW species. The identification of the most influential species within food webs has become a crucial task for conservation purposes in local and regional contexts to maintain ecosystem integrity and the supply of ecosystem services for the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean.},

It will hope to discover whether or not the Gentoo penguin species will, in fact, displace the Adelie penguin species habitat based on the changing climates and differing physiological and habitat preferences. Based on the evidence put forward, there is still a large amount of research that needs to be completed in order to have a good understanding of the population dynamics of both species, and therefore, how they interact with each other. The increases in climate warming will continue to get worse and therefore, action needs to be taken now to address the impacts on Antarctic wildlife before it is too late and extinctions will begin causing massive alterations in the food chains and shifting the entire Antarctic ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The relationship between fish functional diversity and fishing levels at which its baselines shift is important to identify the consequences of fishing in ecosystem functioning. For the first time, the authors of this study implemented a trait-based approach in the Argentine Patagonian Sea to identify the vulnerability and spatiotemporal changes in functional diversity of fish assemblages incidentally captured by a trawling fleet targeting the Argentine red shrimp Pleoticus muelleri (Spence Bate, 1888) between 2003 and 2014. The authors coupled seven fish trophic traits to a reconstructed fish assemblage for the study area and by-catch and evaluated changes in fish species richness and four complementary functional diversity measures (functional richness, redundancy, dispersion and community trait values) along with fishing intensity, temporal use, latitudinal location and depth of fishing grounds, and vessel length. Resident fishes larger than 30 cm in length, with depressed and fusiform bodies, intermediate to high trophic levels, and feeding in benthic, demersal and midwater areas were vulnerable to by-catch. In addition, fish assemblages exhibited a low functional trait redundancy, likely related to species influxes in a biogeographic ecotone with tropicalisation signs. Significant increases in fish trait richness and dispersion poleward and deep suggested new functional roles in these grounds, matching trends in community body size, reproductive load, maximum depth and trophic level. Finally, a temporal increase in fish species and functional trait removal in fishing grounds led to trait homogenisation since 2003. The authors identified that tipping points in temperate fish functional trait diversity showed the importance of trait-based approaches within ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

In order to evaluate warming trends in the Weddell Sea, a historical data set encompassing CTD and bottle data from 1912 to 2000 was analyzed for temporal trends in the deep water masses: warm deep water (WDW) and Weddell Sea deep water (WSDW). The coldest WDW temperatures were primarily associated with the Weddell Polynya of the mid-1970s. Subsequent warming occurred at a rate of {$\sim$}0.012{$\pm$}0.007\textdegree Cyr-1 from the 1970s to 1990s. This warming was comparable to the global, average surface water warming observed by Levitus et al. (Science 287 (2000) 2225), to the warming of the WSBW in the central Weddell Sea observed by Fahrbach et al. (Filchner\textendash Ronne Ice Shelf Program, Report No. 12, Alfred-Wegener-Institut, Bremerhaven, Germany, 1998a, p. 24), and to the surface ice temperature warming from 1970 to 1998 in the Weddell Sea observed by Comiso (J.

The location of the warmest temperature was displaced towards the surface by {$\sim$}200m from the 1970s to the 1990s. Although the average WSDW potential temperatures between 1500 and 3500m were warmer in the 1990s than in the 1970s, high variability in the data prevented identification of a well-defined temporal trend.},

Understanding the differences between these areas is necessary to monitor the changes that are expected to occur in the upcoming decades. Here, we compared the structure and stability of Antarctic (Potter Cove) and sub-Antarctic (Beagle Channel) marine food webs. We compiled species trophic interactions (predator-prey) and calculated complexity, structure and stability metrics. Even if both food webs presented the same connectance, we found important differences between them. The Beagle Channel food web is more complex, but less stable and sensitive to the loss of its most connected species, while the Potter Cove food web presented lower complexity and greater stability against perturbations.},

Based on individual stable isotope analyses and the high taxonomic resolution of sampled specimens, we described benthic food webs in contrasting conditions of seasonal sea-ice persistence (early vs. late sea-ice break up) in medium-depth waters in Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea). The architecture of biodiversity was reshaped by the pulsed input of sympagic food sources following sea-ice break up, with food web simplification, decreased intraguild predation, potential disturbance propagation and increased vulnerability to biodiversity loss. Following our approach, it was possible to describe in unprecedented detail the complex structure of biodiverse communities, emphasising the role of sympagic inputs, regulated by sea-ice dynamics, in structuring Antarctic medium-depth benthic food webs.},

  abstract = {In aquatic environments, plastic pollution occurs concomitantly with anthropogenic climate stressors such as ocean acidification. Within the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill (Euphausia Superba) support many marine predators and play a key role in the biogeochemical cycle. Ocean acidification and plastic pollution have been acknowledged to hinder Antarctic krill development and physiology in singularity, however potential multi-stressor effects of plastic particulates coupled with ocean acidification are unexplored. Furthermore, Antarctic krill may be especially vulnerable to plastic pollution due to their close association with sea-ice, a known plastic sink. Here, we investigate the behaviour of nanoplastic [spherical, aminated (NH2), and yellow-green fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles] in Antarctic seawater and explore the single and combined effects of nanoplastic (160 nm radius, at a concentration of 2.5 {$\mu$}g ml\textendash 1) and ocean acidification (pCO2 {$\sim$}900, pHT 7.7) on the embryonic development of Antarctic krill. Gravid female krill were collected in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean (North Scotia Sea). Produced eggs were incubated at 0.5 \textdegree C in four treatments (control, nanoplastic, ocean acidification and the multi-stressor scenario of nanoplastic presence, and ocean acidification) and their embryonic development after 6 days, at the incubation endpoint, was determined. We observed that negatively charged nanoplastic particles suspended in seawater from the Scotia Sea aggregated to sizes exceeding the nanoscale after 24 h (1054.13 {$\pm$} 53.49 nm). Further, we found that the proportion of embryos developing through the early stages to reach at least the limb bud stage was highest in the control treatment (21.84\%) and lowest in the multi-stressor treatment (13.17\%). Since the biological thresholds to any stressors can be altered by the presence of additional stressors, we propose that future nanoplastic ecotoxicology studies should consider the changing global ocean under future climate scenarios for assessments of their impact and highlight that determining the behaviour of nanoplastic particles used in incubation studies is critical to determining their toxicity.},

The risks for keystone polar species are also considered, incorporating the behavioural and physiological traits of biota and addressing potential `hotspot' areas.

This has potential implications for marine ecosystems, notably phytoplankton growth, biomass, and composition. Fifteen years (1997\textendash 2012) of year-round size fractionated chlorophyll a (Chl a), phytoplankton pigment fingerprinting and environmental data were analyzed to identify the relationship between sea ice cover, water column stability and phytoplankton dynamics in northern Marguerite Bay, Antarctica. Over the investigated period, both summer (December\textendash February) and winter biomass declined significantly, 38.5\% and 33.3\% respectively. Winter phytoplankton biomass was low ({$<$} 0.25 {$\mu$}g Chl a L-1) and consisted on average of 69\% diatoms, 5\% cryptophytes, and 20\% haptophytes. Summers following winters with low ({$<$} 65 days) sea ice cover were characterized by decreased stratification strength and relatively low (median {$<$} 4.4 {$\mu$}g Chl a L-1) phytoplankton biomass, as compared to summers preceded by high winter sea ice cover. In addition, the summertime microphytoplankton ({$>$} 20 {$\mu$}m) fraction was strongly decreased in the low biomass years, from 92\% to 39\%, coinciding with a smaller diatom fraction in favor of nanophytoplankton ({$<$} 20 {$\mu$}m), represented by cryptophytes and haptophytes. In contrast, diatoms dominated ({$>$} 95\%) during summers with average-to-high biomass. We advance a conceptual model whereby low winter sea ice cover leads to low phytoplankton biomass and enhanced proportions of nanophytoplankton, when this coincides with reduced stratification during summer. These changes are likely to have a strong effect on the entire Antarctic marine food web, including krill biomass, and distribution.},

The knowledge of glacial changes and freshwater budgets resulting from intensified glacier melt is an important boundary condition for many biological and integrated earth system science approaches. We provide a case study on glacier and mass balance changes for the ice cap of King George Island. The area loss between 2000 and 2008 amounted to about 20 km2 (about 1.6\% of the island area) and compares to glacier retreat rates observed in previous years. Measured net accumulation rates for two years (2007 and 2008) show a strong interannual variability with maximum net accumulation rates of 4950 mm w.e. a-1 and 3184 mm w.e. a-1, respectively. These net accumulation rates are at least 4 times higher than reported mean values (1926\textendash 95) from an ice core. An elevation dependent precipitation rate of 343 mm w.e. a-1 (2007) and 432 mm w.e. a- 1 (2008) per 100 m elevation increase was observed. Despite these rather high net accumulation rates on the main ice cap, consistent surface lowering was observed at elevations below 270 m above ellipsoid over an 11-year period. These DGPS records reveal a linear dependence of surface lowering with altitude with a maximum annual surface lowering rate of 1.44 ma- 1 at 40 m and - 0.20 ma-1 at 270 m above ellipsoid. These results fit well to observations by other authors and surface lowering rates derived from the ICESat laser altimeter.

Differential wind/tidal relative forcing appeared to drive along-shelf variations in the physical structure of the front and hence, planktonic patterns. Approaching the northern border of the system, the conspicuous presence of Oithona helgolandica, cladocerans and appendicularians, and the low fecundities of calanoid copepods suggest that a high proportion of the primary production may be channelled through microheterotrophic processes. Towards the southern area, calanoids dominated over cyclopoids, `large\textasciiacute{} species (Drepanopus forcipatus, Calanoides cf. carinatus) were abundant, and copepod fecundities were high and steady, suggesting that there may be a more classical-like herbivorous food web. Paracalanus parvus and Ctenocalanus vanus occurred over the whole system but seemed to be key species in mixed and weakly stratified waters. Copepods peaked in stratified waters away from the front itself, while the abundance of eggs and nauplii was highest in weakly stratified waters next to the front. Apparently, the general heating occurring over the region in spring 1998 strongly affected both the physical and biological structure of the system. Unlike in 1995, a massive bloom of gelatinous zooplankton took place in 1998 and a bloom of the phagotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca sp. occurred in the northern area. Co-occurring copepod populations were depressed and their reproductive patterns seemed to be highly disrupted. Present observations stress the significance of variable external forcing in driving satisfactory habitat conditions for juvenile fish in the area.},

This warming has strongly affected the cryosphere, causing the largest ice-shelf collapses ever observed and the retreat of 87\% of glaciers. Ecosystem responses, although increasingly predicted, have been mainly reported for pelagic systems. However, and despite most Antarctic species being benthic, responses in the Antarctic benthos have been detected in only a few species, and major effects at assemblage level are unknown. This is probably due to the scarcity of baselines against which to assess change. We performed repeat surveys of coastal benthos in 1994, 1998, and 2010, analyzing community structure and environmental variables at King George Island, Antarctica. We report a marked shift in an Antarctic benthic community that can be linked to ongoing climate change. However, rather than temperature as the primary factor, we highlight the resulting increased sediment runoff, triggered by glacier retreat, as the potential causal factor. The sudden shift from a filter feeders ascidian domination to a mixed assemblage suggests that thresholds (for example, of tolerable sedimentation) and alternative equilibrium states, depending on the reversibility of the changes, could be possible traits of this ecosystem. Sedimentation processes will be increasing under the current scenario of glacier retreat, and attention needs to be paid to its effects along the AP.},

Model solutions were generated for 2 regions with Ad\'elie penguin Pygoscelis adeliae colonies presenting different population trends (a northern and a southern colony) for a 12 yr period (1995-2006). Counter to the standard paradigm, comparisons of carbon flow through bacteria, microzooplankton, and krill showed that the diatom-krill-top predator food chain is not the dominant pathway for organic carbon exchanges. The food web is more complex, including significant contributions by microzooplankton and the microbial loop. Using both inverse model results and network indices, it appears that in the northern WAP the food web is dominated by the microbial food web, with a temporal trend toward its increasing importance. The dominant pathway for the southern WAP food web varies from year to year, with no detectable temporal trend toward dominance of microzooplankton versus krill. In addition, sensitivity analyses indicated that the northern colony of Ad\'elie penguins, whose population size has been declining over the past 35 yr, appears to have sufficient krill during summer to sustain its basic metabolic needs and rear chicks, suggesting the importance of other processes in regulating the Ad\'elie population decline.},

  abstract = {Maximum and minimum Critical thermal limits (CTMax and CTMin) have been studied extensively to assess thermal tolerance in ectotherms by means of ramping assays. Notothenioid fish have been proposed as particularly sensitive to temperature increases related to global climate change. However, there are large gaps in our understanding of the thermal responses of these extreme cold-adapted fish in assays with heating rates. We evaluated the effects of two commonly used heating rates (0.3 and 1~\textdegree C/min) on the cellular stress responses in the intertidal Antarctic fish Harpagifer antarcticus immediately after CTMax was reached, and at 2 and 4~h of recovery time in ambient water. We compared CTMax values, the relative transcript expression of genes relvant to heat shock response (Hsc70, Hsp70, Grp78), hypoxia (Hif1-{$\alpha$}, LDHa, GR), ubiquitination (Ube2), and apoptosis (SMAC/DIABLO), and five plasma parameters - glucose, lactate, total protein, osmolality and cortisol. CTMax values between the two heating rates are not significantly different, and both rates elicited a similar stress response at molecular and physiological levels. We found a lack of up-regulated response of heat shock proteins, consistent with other Antarctic notothenioids. The general transcriptional pattern trended to downregulation, which was more evident in the slower 0.3~\textdegree C/min rate, and instances of upregulation were mainly related to ubiquitination. The faster 1~\textdegree C/min rate, rarely used for Antarctic fish, can be suitable for studying cold-adapted stenothermic fish without overestimating thermal tolerance or inducing damage from longer heat exposure.},

The categories differed significantly in primary-production-related characteristics in the water column and food availability at the seafloor. Almost all ice-cover categories differed significantly in meiofauna communities (32-500 \textmu m, 20 taxa, 585 825 individuals). Fewer regions differed significantly in macrofauna ({$>$}500 \textmu m, 19 taxa, 3974 individuals) or the combined meiofauna and macrofauna communities. Environmental drivers explained {$>$}66\% of the variation among different communities and differed for the faunal size classes: for meiofauna (84.2\%), sea-ice cover (1 yr) and availability of fresh food (chlorophyll a [chl a]) were most important, whereas 1 yr ice cover, chl a, and total organic carbon were decisive drivers for macrofauna (66.6\%). Grain size, water depth, water-column chl a, long-term ice cover, seafloor temperature, and the carbon/nitrogen ratio influenced communities to a lesser extent. We demonstrated a stronger relationship with sea-ice cover in meiofauna communities than in macrofauna communities, and we recommend including meiofauna in future assessments of the influence of environmental changes on Southern Ocean ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Myctophids are the most abundant and diverse mesopelagic fishes in the Southern Ocean. They are a conduit of energy between primary consumers and higher marine predators, and between the surface layers and the mesopelagic depths. However, there remain major uncertainties about their ecology, particularly regarding their role in Southern Ocean food webs in waters south of the Antarctic Polar Front, which are often regarded as dominated by Antarctic krill. Limited data on the feeding ecology of myctophids has made it difficult to assess the importance of myctophids as consumers of krill and how they fit in the traditional view of a krill-dominated system (diatom-krill-higher predator). We provide a new assessment of the role of myctophids in Southern Ocean food webs using information from recent trophodynamic studies of myctophids conducted in the Scotia Sea, one of the most productive regions of the Southern Ocean and a region that sustains both major populations of higher predators (sea birds, seals, whales) and important commercial fisheries (krill, toothfish, and mackerel icefish). Collectively, these data show that myctophids have a central role in Southern Ocean food webs as both predators and prey. Large myctophid species are prevalent consumers of krill throughout their distributional range and in different seasons in the Scotia Sea. Moreover, best estimates of both myctophid and higher predator consumption of krill to date indicate that large myctophids are the greatest predators of krill in this region, consuming almost as much krill as do all other vertebrates. Nevertheless, there are several smaller myctophid species that do not eat krill, instead consuming copepods and other small euphausiids. Myctophids therefore link primary producers to higher predators through both krill-dependent and krill-independent trophic pathways, emphasizing their importance in regional food webs. Consequently, trophic pathways involving large myctophids are unlikely to be exempt from the direct consequences of projected redistribution and/or reduction in krill population biomass under scenarios of ocean-warming, whilst trophic pathways involving small myctophids may be more resilient to such effects and become increasingly important to higher trophic levels. Further studies are required to determine the extent to which myctophids can maintain food web stability and sustain higher predator populations during periods of prolonged reductions in krill abundance. Including knowledge of the role of myctophids in Southern Ocean food webs will be important for developing robust projections of the impacts of future change to inform decision making for conservation and management.},

We used quali- and quantitative data obtained from research cruises developed by Argentina in 2016 and 2017. The results showed that Porifera was the most important component (in terms of wet biomass) of these benthic communities, followed by Cnidaria and Echinodermata. The evidences regarding general composition of the main taxonomical groups of the benthic invertebrate community did not support the maintenance of the original zoning of the MPA (core, buffer, and transition), considering that only a weak differentiation was found among the sub-areas designed in the creation Law. Additionally, the analyzed evidences also demonstrated that this MPA was different from other neighboring areas. Vulnerable and fragile organisms recorded in many locations led to the detection of fourteen sites located inside the MPA Namuncur\'a that meet the characteristics of VMEs (wet biomass of\,{$\geq$}\,10~kg 1200~m-2 of vulnerable and fragile species). These evidences reinforce the conservation value of these particular and susceptible sub-Antarctic benthic communities, composed of both Antarctic and Magellanic species.},

Since 1991 hydrographical characteristics and phytoplankton dynamics were monitored at two stations in Potter Cove, a fjord-like environment on the southeastern KGI coastline. Seawater temperature and salinity, total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass) concentrations were measured in summer and winter over a 19-year period, together with local air temperature. Mean air temperatures rose by 0.39 and 0.48 \textdegree C per decade in summer and winter, respectively. Positive anomalies characterized wind speeds during the decade between the mid '90 and the mid 2000 years, whereas negative anomalies were observed from 2004 onwards. Day of sea ice formation and retreat, based on satellite data, did not change, although total sea ice cover diminished during the studied period. Surface water temperature increased during summer (0.36 \textdegree C per decade), whereas no trend was observed in salinity. Summer Chl-a concentrations were around 1 mg m-3 Chl-a with no clear trend throughout the study period. TSPM increased in surface waters of the inner cove during the spring-summer months. The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) climate signal was apparent in the fluctuating interannual pattern of the hydrographic variables in the outer Potter Cove and bottom waters whereas surface hydrography was strongly governed by the local forcing of glacier melt. The results show that global trends have significant effects on local hydrographical and biological conditions in the coastal marine environments of Western Antarctica.},

  abstract = {The Beagle Channel at the southernmost tip of South America is an interoceanic passage connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans. It is characterized by intricate coastlines and changing bathymetry, a dominant West to East circulation pattern, and a strong longitudinal gradient of glacial fresh-water discharge. Harmful algal blooms (HAB) and toxic outbreaks have been detected along the channel for the last two decades and monitored by both Chilean and Argentinean agencies. This unique scenario was used to try to answer whether HABs propagate from West to East along the channel following the main water flow, so that a sequential, spatial pattern can be identified, or if local dynamics due to particular hydrographic characteristics might favor HAB formation in different areas along the channel. For this analysis, we selected data from three austral springsummer seasons, 2009\textendash 2010, 2010\textendash 2011, and 2012\textendash 2013, when by means of the mouse bioassay important concentrations of saxitoxins (STX) derivatives were detected in shellfish from different stations along the channel. Relevant information on hydrographical (temperature, salinity, bathymetry, main currents), chemical (macronutrients), and biological (cell abundance of the main species responsible for the toxic outbreaks in the channel, i.e. Alexandrium catenella) characteristics are analyzed. Results show that during the years when toxicity was highest, there was no evidence of West to East (longitudinal) transport of toxins along the channel. Con\- trastingly, smaller-scale patterns could explain the observed dynamics associated with three sub-basins previ\- ously described for the Beagle Channel, identified as western, central, and eastern regions. We built a conceptual model based on own and published data on bathymetry, PAR, salinity, water residence time, silicate availability, and DOM to understand the differences in HAB presence among the sub-basins, which allows explaining the higher toxicity values registered in the central part of the channel as compared to the western or easternmost regions.},

  abstract = {A compilation of more than 30 studies shows that adult Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) may frequent benthic habitats year-round, in shelf as well as oceanic waters and throughout their circumpolar range. Net and acoustic data from the Scotia Sea show that in summer 2-20\% of the population reside at depths between 200 and 2000 m, and that large aggregations can form above the seabed. Local differences in the vertical distribution of krill indicate that reduced feeding success in surface waters, either due to predator encounter or food shortage, might initiate such deep migrations and results in benthic feeding. Fatty acid and microscopic analyses of stomach content confirm two different foraging habitats for Antarctic krill: the upper ocean, where fresh phytoplankton is the main food source, and deeper water or the seabed, where detritus and copepods are consumed. Krill caught in upper waters retain signals of benthic feeding, suggesting frequent and dynamic exchange between surface and seabed. Krill contained up to 260 nmol iron per stomach when returning from seabed feeding. About 5\% of this iron is labile, i.e., potentially available to phytoplankton. Due to their large biomass, frequent benthic feeding, and acidic digestion of particulate iron, krill might facilitate an input of new iron to Southern Ocean surface waters. Deep migrations and foraging at the seabed are significant parts of krill ecology, and the vertical fluxes involved in this behavior are important for the coupling of benthic and pelagic food webs and their elemental repositories.},

Total Hg and stable isotopes were measured in samples of particulate organic matter (POM), zooplankton, squid, myctophid fish, notothenioid fish and seabird tissues collected in two years (austral summers 2007/08 and 2016/17). Overall, there was extensive overlap in {$\delta$}13C values across taxonomic groups suggesting similarities in habitats, with the exception of the seabirds, which showed some differences, possibly due to the type of tissue analysed (feathers instead of muscle). {$\delta$}15N showed increasing enrichment across groups in the order POM to zooplankton to squid to myctophid fish to notothenioid fish to seabirds. There were significant differences in {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C values among species within taxonomic groups, reflecting inter-specific variation in diet. Hg concentrations increased with trophic level, with the lowest values in POM (0.0005~{$\pm~$}0.0002~{$\mu$}g~g-1 dw) and highest values in seabirds (3.88~{$\pm~$}2.41~{$\mu$}g~g-1 in chicks of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus). Hg concentrations tended to be lower in 2016/17 than in 2007/08 for mid-trophic level species (squid and fish), but the opposite was found for top predators (i.e. seabirds), which had higher levels in the 2016/17 samples. This may reflect an interannual shift in the Scotia Sea marine food web, caused by the reduced availability of a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. In 2016/17, seabirds would have been forced to feed on higher trophic-level prey, such as myctophids, that have higher Hg burdens. These results suggest that changes in the food web are likely to affect the pathway of mercury to Southern Ocean top predators.},

  abstract = {Marine species are shifting their distributions due to climate change, leading to a tropicalization of temperate reefs as warm-affinity species become dominant. Despite profound changes, we know little about the mechanisms driving ecosystem reconfiguration. In Chapter 2, I investigated temporal changes in fish functional diversity on warming reefs in the Solitary Islands. An increase in functional diversity over time was driven by increases in the abundance of smaller-sized, faster-growing fishes. I found similar changes along a cross-shelf spatial gradient of tropicalization, with coral-dominated offshore sites also characterized by more tropical and faster-growing species than inshore kelp-dominated sites. These findings suggest that the spatial changes observed along the cross-shelf gradient can provide an effective space-for-time substitution that can help predict changes in fish assemblages caused by warming. In chapter 3, I examined potential mechanisms underpinning climate change impacts on tropicalized fish communities and their food sources (including detritus and zooplankton) along two space-for-time substitutions: the same cross-shelf longitudinal gradient in the Solitary Islands and a tropical-to-temperate latitudinal gradient across 21\textdegree{} of latitude in eastern Australia. I observed an increase in fish biomass from kelp-dominated to coral-dominated reefs in the cross-shelf gradient as well as more nutritious detritus and higher zooplankton biomass. I also found an increase in fish species richness from kelp-to-coral in the latitudinal gradient, but detrital quality decreased towards the tropics. The increase in fish species richness in more `tropical-like' sites in latitude and longitude suggests that space-for-time substitution may help to predict future ecosystem states. However, the data collected within this study suggest neither detritus nutritional quality nor zooplankton biomass are likely to be key drivers of tropicalization. In chapter 4, I designed a novel field-based method to quantify piscivory using an acrylic dome with a fish inside to attract predators. I found that this technique can successfully quantify predation by piscivores and omnivorous fishes. A pilot study showed higher levels of predation in tropical reefs, suggesting we can expect an intensification in these biotic interactions with tropicalization. My thesis contributes to disentangling some of the mechanisms driving the tropicalization of temperate reefs.},

  abstract = {Disturbance has always shaped the evolution and ecology of organisms and nowhere is this more apparent that on the iceberg gouged continental shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). The vast majority of currently described polar biodiversity occurs on the Southern Ocean shelf but current and projected climate change is rapidly altering disturbance intensities in some regions. The AP is now amongst the fastest warming and changing regions on earth. Seasonal sea ice has decreased in time and extent, most glaciers in the region have retreated, a number of ice shelves have collapsed, and the surface waters of the seas west of the AP have warmed. Here, we review the influences of disturbance from ice, sedimentation, freshening events, wave action and humans on shallow water benthic assemblages, and suggest how disturbance pressures will change during the 21st century in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and Scotia Arc region. We suggest that the intensity of ice scouring will increase in the region over the next few decades as a result of decreased winter sea ice periods and increased ice loading into coastal waters. Thus, the most frequently disturbed environment on earth will become more so, which will lead to considerable changes in community structure and species distributions. However, as ice fronts retreat past their respective grounding lines, sedimentation and freshening events will become relatively more important. Human presence in the region is increasing, through research, tourism, and resource exploitation, which represents a considerable threat to polar biodiversity over the next century. Adapting to or tolerating multiple, changing environmental stressors will be difficult for a fauna with typically slow generation turnovers that has evolved largely in isolation. We suggest that intensifying acute and chronic disturbances are likely to cause significant changes in ecosystem structure, and probably a considerable loss of polar marine biodiversity, over relatively short timescales.},

We collected a multiyear data set on ice scouring frequency from Antarctica by using unique experimental markers and scuba diving surveys. We show that the annual intensity of ice scouring is negatively correlated with the duration of the winter fast ice season. Because fast ice extent and duration is currently in decline in the region after recent rapid warming, it is likely that marine benthic communities are set for even more scouring in the near future.}

  abstract = {The South Sandwich Islands (SSI), a chain of volcanic islands in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, are home to two large notothenoid species: the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides and the Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni. Both species support valuable fisheries throughout the Southern Ocean under management of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The SSI region, which is located south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, has a diverse and distinct biodiversity and it represents a range edge for the distribution of both toothfish species. In this paper we have updated and expanded previous biological analyses with recent data, explored the stock hypotheses and links of these species to other regions, and investigated the role of the SSI archipelago in the life cycles of both toothfish species, where they overlap in their distribution. We conclude that Patagonian toothfish around the SSI are linked to the adjacent South Georgia population, but have some unique characteristics, including faster growth and better somatic condition, possibly reflecting `Bergmann's rule' which states that body size increases with decreasing temperature and increasing latitude. By comparison, the Antarctic toothfish at the SSI appear to be the northern extent of a larger stock connecting further south towards the Antarctic continent. Finally, we consider the relative importance of the SSI in the life cycle of both species, including in the context of climatic changes to this region.},

The consumption of glucose-6-phosphate, derived from hexokinase (HK), by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) decreased in N.~rossii heart within 6~h at 8~\textdegree C, with a subsequent increase at 72~h. In N.~rossii muscle at 8~\textdegree C, glycolysis was stimulated within 2~h by an increase in pyruvate kinase (PK), and aerobic metabolism was stimulated at 144~h, together with anaerobiosis. In N.~coriiceps heart at 8~\textdegree C, glucose break down by HK decreased within 2~h and subsequently increased at 12 and 24~h. Increased glucose-6-phosphate consumption by G6PDH occurred within 6~h at 8~\textdegree C. In N.~coriiceps muscle at 8~\textdegree C, glycolysis was stimulated at 2 and 6~h, with subsequent inhibition within 24~h, as indicated by HK activity. Aerobic metabolism was inhibited at 72 and 144~h at 8~\textdegree C through the inhibition of citrate synthase (CS). Heat stress caused responses were only occasional and transient in antioxidant defence system of both species in the heart and muscle, leading to increased glutathione (GSH) and decreased levels of lipoperoxidation in the heart of both species. The results obtained in this study in the heart and muscles indicate that under heat stress at 8~\textdegree C, N.~rossii is more responsive than N.~coriiceps with respect to carbohydrate metabolism.},

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

We still lack a clear picture if and to what extent the energy metabolism and mitochondrial enzymes of Antarctic fish can compensate for changing temperatures or PCO2 and whether capacities for compensation differ between tissues. We therefore measured activities of key mitochondrial enzymes (citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome c oxidase (COX)) from heart, red muscle, white muscle and liver in the Antarctic fish Notothenia rossii after warm- (7\textdegree C) and hypercapnia- (0.2kPa CO2) acclimation vs. control conditions (1\textdegree C, 0.04kPa CO2). In heart, enzymes showed elevated activities after cold-hypercapnia acclimation, and a warm-acclimation-induced upward shift in thermal optima. The strongest increase in enzyme activities in response to hypercapnia occurred in red muscle. In white muscle, enzyme activities were temperature-compensated. CS activity in liver decreased after warm-normocapnia acclimation (temperature-compensation), while COX activities were lower after cold- and warm-hypercapnia exposure, but increased after warm-normocapnia acclimation. In conclusion, warm-acclimated N. rossii display low thermal compensation in response to rising energy demand in highly aerobic tissues, such as heart and red muscle. Chronic environmental hypercapnia elicits increased enzyme activities in these tissues, possibly to compensate for an elevated energy demand for acid\textendash base regulation or a compromised mitochondrial metabolism, that is predicted to occur in response to hypercapnia exposure. This might be supported by enhanced metabolisation of liver energy stores. These patterns reflect a limited capacity of N. rossii to reorganise energy metabolism in response to rising temperature and PCO2.},

Interactions intrinsically vary across space and time, and given the number of species that compose ecological communities, it can be tough to distinguish between a true negative (where two species never interact) from a false negative (where two species have not been observed interacting even though they actually do). Assessing the likelihood of interactions between species is an imperative for several fields of ecology. This means that to predict interactions between species\textemdash and to describe the structure, variation, and change of the ecological networks they form\textemdash we need to rely on modelling tools. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept, where we show how a simple neural network model makes accurate predictions about species interactions given limited data. We then assess the challenges and opportunities associated with improving interaction predictions, and provide a conceptual roadmap forward towards predictive models of ecological networks that is explicitly spatial and temporal. We conclude with a brief primer on the relevant methods and tools needed to start building these models, which we hope will guide this research programme forward.

  abstract = {Seabird bycatch in fisheries, and the development of effective mitigation to minimize this, have been subject to increasing research attention over the past three to four decades. Trawl fisheries represent a particular challenge, as bird mortalities (especially highly threatened albatrosses and large petrels, Procellariforms) occur primarily through difficult-to-detect collisions with warp and net monitoring cables. Effectiveness of bird-scaring lines (BSLs) as a mitigation measure can be fleet-specific, and studies relating specifically to reducing collisions with the net monitoring cable are rare. To support improved assessment and mitigation of seabird bycatch in trawl fisheries, we studied the mortality associated with mid-water and bottom factory trawl vessels along the southern tip of the Argentine Patagonian shelf, across 2144 trawls from 2012 to 2019, with three specific objectives: (i) inform improved bycatch management in this (and other) trawl fisheries by analysing differences in seabird collision rates and outcomes between net monitoring and warp cables, as well as the effect of mitigation measures in reducing collisions; (ii) explore the effects of key fishing operation variables on seabird impact outcomes; and (iii) estimate the annual seabird mortality in the study fleet. We tested the efficacy of BSLs as a mitigation measure to reduce seabird mortality, on warps and net monitoring cables. Our results show that seabird mortality increases in the presence of a net monitoring cable. Our estimation of fishery-wide mortality without the use of BSLs includes 108 [31\textendash 186] Southern royal albatross (Diomedea epomophora) and 279 [108\textendash 465] Black-browed albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) killed annually by the collisions with the net monitoring cable. We demonstrate the efficacy of BSLs in reducing the number of collisions and in combination with no discarding of fishes, seabird interactions fell to c. zero. Our study builds the case for better bycatch data collection in trawl fisheries, the strong influence of discarding, and the feasibility of simple mitigation measures to reduce seabird bycatch, including on the net monitoring cable.},

  abstract = {The biogeographic response of oceanic planktonic communities to climatic change has a large influence on the future stability of marine food webs and the functioning of global biogeochemical cycles. Temperature plays a pivotal role in determining the distribution of these communities and ocean warming has the potential to cause major distributional shifts, particularly in polar regions where the thermal envelope is narrow. We considered the impact of long-term ocean warming on the spatial distribution of Southern Ocean mesozooplankton communities through examining plankton abundance in relation to sea surface temperature between two distinct periods, separated by around 60 years. Analyses considered 16 dominant mesozooplankton taxa (in terms of biomass and abundance) in the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, from net samples and in situ temperature records collected during the Discovery Investigations (1926\textendash 1938) and contemporary campaigns (1996\textendash 2013). Sea surface temperature was found to have increased significantly by 0.74\textdegree C between the two eras. The corresponding sea surface temperature at which community abundance peaked was also significantly higher in contemporary times, by 0.98\textdegree C. Spatial projections indicated that the geographical location of community peak abundance had remained the same between the two eras despite the poleward advance of sea surface isotherms. If the community had remained within the same thermal envelope as in the 1920s\textendash 1930s, community peak abundance would be 500 km further south in the contemporary era. Studies in the northern hemisphere have found that dominant taxa, such as calanoid copepods, have conserved their thermal niches and tracked surface isotherms polewards. The fact that this has not occurred in the Southern Ocean suggests that other selective pressures, particularly food availability and the properties of underlying water masses, place greater constraints on spatial distributions in this region. It further demonstrates that this community is thermally resilient to present levels of sea surface warming.},

  abstract = {Antarctic benthos exhibits highly complex communities showing a wide array of spatial patterns at several scales which are poorly quantified. In this study, we introduce the use of methods borrowed from landscape ecology to study quantitatively spatial patterns in the Antarctic megaepibenthic communities. This discipline focuses on the notion that communities can be observed as a patch mosaic at any scale. From this perspective we investigated spatial patterns in an Antartcic benthic assemblage across different stations based on landscape indices, and we chose the optimal subset for describing Antarctic benthic patterns. For this purpose, 42 photographs (1 m2 each) corresponding to 6 stations from the Weddell Sea shelf were investigated. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) showed the arrangement of photographic records along a patch size and diversity gradient on the first axis and a heterogeneity pattern gradient (cover area, interspersion and juxtaposition, landscape shape indices) on the second axis. Based on a forward stepwise selection, mean patch size (MPS), patch size coefficient of deviation (PSCV), patch richness (PR), interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI), mean shape index (MSI), Shannon{$^1$}s evenness (SHEI), and periarea index (PERIAREA) were chosen as the adequate subset of indices to describe the Antarctic benthos. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify relationships among them. The resulting 3 factors were interpreted as (1) a heterogeneity pattern (related to patch size, form, diversity, and interspersion indices), (2) an equitability pattern (represented by the evenness index), and (3) a perimeter-area pattern (characterised by the periarea index). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to detect differences among the stations based on the subset of indices. Overall, the results showed large differences in patch characteristics (mean and its coefficient of variation, and shape indices), diversity, and interspersion. The successful description of Antarctic benthic communities through landscape pattern indices provides a useful tool for the characterisation and comparison of spatial patterns in these diverse marine benthic habitats, which gives insights in their organisation.},

A large proportion of taxa (64.4\%) occupied integer trophic positions, suggesting that discrete trophic levels do exist. Importantly however, the majority of those trophic positions were aggregated around integer values of 0 and 1, representing plants and herbivores. For the majority of the real food webs considered here, secondary consumers were no more likely to occupy an integer trophic position than in randomized food webs. This means that, above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores. Omnivory was most common in marine systems, rarest in streams, and intermediate in lakes and terrestrial food webs. Trophic-level-based concepts such as trophic cascades may apply to systems with short food chains, but they become less valid as food chains lengthen.},

One of the earliest implementations was in the Southern Ocean, where decision rules and stock reference points were developed for managing the Antarctic krill fishery, together with an ecosystem-monitoring programme intended to aid management decisions. This latter component has not been incorporated directly into management, so here, we consider variability in the krill fishery at South Georgia, relating it to physical and biological monitoring indices, finding sea surface temperature to be a key correlate with both annual catch and long-term biological indices. Some indices from krill predators showed significant positive relationships with krill harvesting in the preceding winter, presumably indicative of the importance of winter foraging conditions. We explore how ecological structure affects results, examining two monitoring sites 100\,km apart. Results suggest different biological conditions at the two sites, probably reflecting different scales of ecosystem operation, emphasizing that an appreciation of scale will enhance krill fishery management. Finally, in reviewing different drivers of ecological change, we identify important additional monitoring that would help better reflect ecosystem status, improve the utility of CEMP, providing information necessary for the ecosystem approach at South Georgia.},

  abstract = {South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) comprise an Overseas Territory of the UK. For over two centuries, the islands and surrounding waters were subject to serial over-exploitation of commercially valuable marine species. First seals, then whales, and later some species of fish were harvested to virtual economic extinction. Today, exploitation is strictly regulated: through the multilateral Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources; through the commercial whaling moratorium of the International Whaling Commission; and now, increasingly, through local sovereign government legislation. Commercial fisheries still operate for three species of fish and one species of crustacean, Antarctic krill. Here, I consider aspects of these fisheries, to help inform the current review of the SGSSI Marine Protected Area (MPA), highlighting how future management must take into account important ongoing changes in this biodiverse ecosystem. Two issues are of paramount importance: ongoing recovery of baleen whale species; and climate change. Both increase uncertainty for fisheries managers, so that considerations about their implications must now be directly included into the management of harvested and dependent species. With the recovery of some previously exploited species, and ongoing recovery of others, the MPA could now be managed with additional ecologically-appropriate large no-take areas, commensurate with increasing levels of ocean protection advocated for by a growing number of scientists and governments. Spatial protection reflecting the habitat use of baleen whales and their prey, krill, would, through umbrella protection, also protect other biodiversity integral to the operation of the marine ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Southern Ocean food webs provide ecosystem services with significant global value including carbon sequestration, fisheries and the existence of iconic wildlife. These services are underpinned by different energetic pathways including those dominated by Antarctic krill, fishes and squids, or gelatinous zooplankton (salps). Climate change is likely to impact Southern Ocean food webs by affecting their foundations \textemdash{} both primary producer communities and ice habitats. However, the implications of these changes for ecosystem services \textendash{} including wildlife populations, fisheries and carbon sequestration \textendash{} are unclear, as are the implications for policy and management. Here, we use a generalised representation of Southern Ocean food webs and qualitative network modelling to investigate the consequences of five simple but plausible scenarios of future change for ecosystem services and the conservation of important taxa: (i) a shift in primary producer communities with decreasing large diatoms and increasing small flagellates; (ii) increasing salps; (iii) increase (recovery) of the Great whales; and unregulated and unsustainable fisheries for (iv) krill or (v) toothfish. Strikingly, our results suggest that increases in salps might not have negative consequences for ecosystem services and could enhance carbon export potential. Simulated increases in unregulated krill and toothfish fisheries affect predatory wildlife and could also reduce carbon export potential. Our results emphasise the important policy implications of understanding the structure and change of whole food webs, and highlight that improved quantitative understanding and modelling of the relative importance of different energy pathways will be important for developing robust management responses to climate change impacts.},

  abstract = {The West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and adjacent Scotia Sea support abundant wildlife populations, many of which were nearly extirpated by humans. This region is also among the fastest-warming areas on the planet, with 5\textendash 6 \textdegree C increases in mean winter air temperatures and associated decreases in winter sea-ice cover. These biological and physical perturbations have affected the ecosystem profoundly. One hypothesis guiding ecological interpretations of changes in top predator populations in this region, the ``sea-ice hypothesis,'' proposes that reductions in winter sea ice have led directly to declines in ``ice-loving'' species by decreasing their winter habitat, while populations of ``ice-avoiding'' species have increased. However, 30 y of field studies and recent surveys of penguins throughout the WAP and Scotia Sea demonstrate this mechanism is not controlling penguin populations; populations of both ice-loving Ad\'elie and ice-avoiding chinstrap penguins have declined significantly. We argue in favor of an alternative, more robust hypothesis that attributes both increases and decreases in penguin populations to changes in the abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill. Unlike many other predators in this region, Ad\'elie and chinstrap penguins were never directly harvested by man; thus, their population trajectories track the impacts of biological and environmental changes in this ecosystem. Linking trends in penguin abundance with trends in krill biomass explains why populations of Ad\'elie and chinstrap penguins increased after competitors (fur seals, baleen whales, and some fishes) were nearly extirpated in the 19th to mid-20th centuries and currently are decreasing in response to climate change.},

Various atmospheric and oceanic factors played a part in the change. Ice loss started in September 2016 when the northern Weddell Sea experienced westerly winds of record strength, advecting multiyear sea ice from the region. In late 2016, a polynya over Maud Rise contributed to low SIE over the eastern Weddell Sea. With extensive areas of open water early in the summer, upper ocean temperatures increased by 0.5\textdegree C, with the anomalies persisting in subsequent years. The reappearance of the Maud Rise polynya in 2017, high ocean temperatures, and storms of record depth kept the summer SIE low.},

We found that the same underlying processes could result in synergistic, additive or antagonistic interactions, with interaction type depending on initial conditions, experiment duration, stressor dynamics and consumer presence. Our results help explain why meta-analyses of multiple stressor experimental results have struggled to identify predictors of consistently non-additive interactions in the natural environment. Experiments run over extended temporal scales, with treatments across gradients of stressor magnitude, are needed to identify the processes that underpin how stressors interact and provide useful predictions to management.},

Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to environmental change.

Seasonal changes and differences in the fish communities that inhabit the canopy and the holdfast were also studied. Two patches of kelp forest separated by 200~m were selected. In one, the canopy was removed periodically while the other was used as a control. Samples were collected seasonally, from autumn 1999 to 2001. Fish fauna in the water column was sampled using trammel nets and holdfast fish fauna was sampled by removing the complete holdfast. Different assemblages of fish species were captured in the water column (surface and bottom) and in the holdfast. In the former there were mainly pelagic and benthopelagic species and the latter predominantly demersal species. The principal effect of the canopy removal was a drop in the abundance (and total weight) of Paranotothenia magellanica (doradito), the species with the strongest relationship with the canopy, principally at the surface of the treated patch probably due to a reduction in the availability of refuges. A high degree of seasonality was observed for fish species' total weight, abundance and diversity, with higher values in summer and autumn. Taking into account our data and available data on kelp growth in the same locality, we suggest of cutting the kelp forest (preferably those farther away from the coast) once a year in winter or early spring, in order to minimize impact on the fish community.},

Individuals were captured in the vicinity of Ushuaia Bay. Experimental temperatures were 10, 4 and 2 \textdegree C, which correspond to summer, winter and extreme winter respectively. Individual respirometry chambers and calorimetric techniques were used. Different food items were provided: crustaceans (isopods and amphipods) and Argentinean hake muscle. Interspecific analysis was done on species fed with isopods. A rapid increase in oxygen consumption was registered after meals, indicating a typical SDA response. The Duration of the SDA was longer at low temperatures. The extra energy spent during the process itself, and when expressed as a percentage of consumed food energy, decreased with decreasing temperature. The SDA Coefficient was higher for H. bispinis that were fed with isopods. We suggest that decreases in temperature diminish the metabolic cost and extend SDA. Energy-saving mechanisms could be an evolutionary advantage to minimize the energetic cost of living at low sub-Antarctic temperatures. A general model of exponential decay is suggested for the duration of SDA and Temperature, based on the present study and compiled from literature data.},

In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to `barrens' when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs.},

  abstract = {Temperate reefs from around the world are becoming tropicalised, as warm-water species shift their distribution towards the poles in response to warming. This is already causing profound shifts in dominant foundation species and associated ecological communities as canopy seaweeds such as kelp are replaced by tropical species. Here, we argue that the cascading consequences of tropicalisation for the ecosystem properties and functions of warming temperate reefs depend largely on the taxa that end up dominating the seafloor. We put forward three potential tropicalisation trajectories, that differ in whether seaweeds, turf or corals become dominant. We highlight potential gains to certain ecosystem functions for some tropicalisation endpoints. For example, local benthic fish productivity may increase in some tropicalised reefs as a higher proportion of primary production is directly consumed, but this will be at the expense of other functions such as carbon export. We argue that understanding these changes in flows of energy and materials is essential to formulate new conservation strategies and management approaches that minimise risks as well as capture potential opportunities. Regardless of which trajectory is followed, tropicalised systems represent largely novel ecosystem configurations. This poses major challenges to traditional conservation and environmental management approaches, which typically focus on maintaining or returning species to particular locations. We outline management practices that may either mitigate predicted structural and functional changes or make the most of potential new opportunities in tropicalised reefs. These include marine protected areas to increase resilience and connectivity, the development of new fisheries that target range-expanding invaders, and assisted evolution and migration strategies to facilitate the dominance of large habitat formers like corals or seaweeds. We highlight important ecological and ethical challenges associated with developing novel approaches to manage tropicalised reefs, which may need to become increasingly interventionist. As technological innovations continue to emerge, having clear goals and considering the ethics surrounding interventions among the broader community are essential steps to successfully develop novel management approaches.

  abstract = {Predictions on the consequences of the rapidly increasing atmospheric CO2 levels and associated climate warming for population dynamics, ecological community structure and ecosystem functioning depend on mechanistic energetic models of temperature effects on populations and their interactions. However, such mechanistic approaches combining warming effects on metabolic (energy loss of organisms) and feeding rates (energy gain by organisms) remain a key, yet elusive, goal. Aiming to fill this void, we studied the metabolic rates and functional responses of three differently sized, predatory ground beetles on one mobile and one more resident prey species across a temperature gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 \textdegree C). Synthesizing metabolic and functional-response theory, we develop novel mechanistic predictions how predator\textendash prey interaction strengths (i.e., functional responses) should respond to warming. Corroborating prior theory, warming caused strong increases in metabolism and decreases in handling time. Consistent with our novel model, we found increases in predator attack rates on a mobile prey, whereas attack rates on a mostly resident prey remained constant across the temperature gradient. Together, these results provide critically important information that environmental warming generally increases the direct short-term per capita interaction strengths between predators and their prey as described by functional-response models. Nevertheless, the several fold stronger increase in metabolism with warming caused decreases in energetic efficiencies (ratio of per capita feeding rate to metabolic rate) for all predator\textendash prey interactions.

Discovery samples were obtained using an N70V closing net fished vertically through three depth horizons encompassing the top 250~m of the water column, whereas contemporary samples were obtained using a Bongo net fished vertically through 200\textendash 0~m. Data from a previous study comparing catch efficiencies of the two nets were used to generate calibration factors which were applied to the N70V abundances. Following further corrections for net depth differences and seasonal biases in sampling frequency, three of the four species, Calanoides acutus, Rhincalanus gigas and Calanus simillimus, were found to be between\,\textasciitilde\,20\textendash 55\% more abundant in contemporary times than they were 70~years ago. Calanus propinquus was marginally more abundant in the Discovery era. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses for the net calibration factor, seasonal bias and net depth corrections. Although near-surface ocean temperatures within the Scotia Sea have increased by up to 1.5~\textdegree C during the last 70~years, we conclude that the most likely causes of increased copepod abundances are linked to changes in the food-web. In particular, we discuss the reported decrease in krill abundance in the South Atlantic that has potentially increased the amount of food available to copepods while at the same time decreasing predator pressure.},

We use a unique data set of Weddell Leptonychotes weddellii and crabeater seals' (CESs) Lobodon carcinophaga breeding season distribution in the Weddell Sea, determined from satellite imagery. We contrast the theoretical climate impacts on both ice-obligate predators who differ in life-history characteristics: CESs are highly specialized Antarctic krill Euphausia superba predators and breed in the seasonal pack ice; Weddell seals (WESs) are generalist predators and breed on comparatively stable fast ice. We used presence\textendash absence data and a suite of remotely sensed environmental variables to build habitat models. Each of the environmental predictors is multiplied by a `climate change score' based on known responses to climate change to create a `change importance product'. Results show CESs are more sensitive to climate change than WESs. Crabeater seals prefer to breed close to krill, and the compounding effects of changing sea ice concentrations and sea surface temperatures, the proximity to krill and abundance of stable breeding ice, can influence their post-breeding foraging success and ultimately their future breeding success. But in contrast to the Ross Sea, here WESs prefer to breed closer to larger colonies of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri). This suggests that the Weddell Sea may currently be prey-abundant, allowing the only two air-breathing Antarctic silverfish predators (Pleuragramma antarctica) (WESs and emperor penguins) to breed closer to each other. This is the first basin-scale, region-specific comparison of breeding season habitat in these two key Antarctic predators based on real-world data to compare climate change responses. This work shows that broad-brush, basin-scale approaches to understanding species-specific responses to climate change are not always appropriate, and regional models are needed\textemdash especially when designing marine protected areas.},

  abstract = {The Southern Ocean is known to have warmed considerably during the second half of the 20th century but there are few locations with data before the 1950s. In addition, assessments of change in this region are hampered by the strong seasonal bias in sampling, with the vast majority of data collected during the austral summer. However, oceanographic measurements near South Georgia span most of the last century, and we here consider almost year-round data from this location over an 81-year period (1925\textendash 2006). We observe significant warming between the early and late 20th century, with differential warming between summer and winter months and an indication that late 20th century summer temperatures peaked {$\sim$}6 days earlier. To quantify the long-term warming trend in this highly variable data, a mixed model utilising a Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) method was used. Over the 81-year period, a mean increase of {$\sim$}0.9\textdegree C in January and {$\sim$}2.3\textdegree C in August was evident in the top 100m of the water column. Warming diminished below 100m and approached 0 at 200m. Thus the long-term warming around South Georgia is substantial\textemdash more so than documented previously for the circumpolar warming of the Southern Ocean. We examine potential causal effects of this trend, including local atmospheric and cryospheric change, the influence of upstream waters and the role of coupled modes of climate variability such as El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is likely that all of these play a part in the observed temperature increase. However, the role of the SAM is strongly indicated, via its likely role in the circumpolar warming trend in the Southern Ocean, and also by the atypical response of the South Georgia region to changes in heat fluxes associated with the SAM. Furthermore, the combination of a regional decline in ice extent and strong upstream warming likely explains a significant part of the strong seasonal variation apparent in the warming trend. In addition, we consider the implications that long-term warming has for South Georgia's lower trophic levels. For Euphausia superba, at their northern limit, we find a significant negative relationship between summer South Georgia water temperatures and mean summer density of E. superba across the southwest Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Simple abundance and growth rate relationships with our long-term temperature data appear to show declining habitat suitability for E. superba. In contrast, the warming trend is likely to favour other macro- and mesozooplankton species that occupy the more northerly parts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and it is likely to promote phytoplankton growth.},

  abstract = {The Scotia Sea area has high productivity relative to the Southern Ocean as a whole, but this displays strong latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. Elucidating the extent of these from a single cruise is problematic, given the high variability of bloom timing and location in this region. Therefore, this study used data from transects across the central Scotia Sea in spring, summer and autumn of 2006, 2008 and 2009, combined with satellite data, to obtain a larger-scale appreciation of the latitudinal contrasts in phytoplankton standing stock and primary production across the region. Concentrations of nitrate, phosphate and particularly silicic acid increased towards the south of the transect with the latter showing a step change at the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front (SACCF). Changes in seasonal nutrient concentrations indicated increasing phytoplankton uptake north of {$\sim$}57\textdegree S that peaked at {$\sim$}53\textdegree S in the Georgia Basin. Based on seasonal depletions of nitrate relative to phosphate, the highest relative nitrate uptake occurred northwest of South Georgia on the periphery of the Georgia Basin, indicating efficient nitrate use here due to iron-replete conditions. An integrative approach to examine these gradients was with the use of 10-year satellite climatology data. These showed that the lowest mean chlorophyll a (chl-a) values were in the central/northern Scotia Sea, but these were still substantial values, 67\% of values within the Georgia Basin bloom. Cruise data on chl-a and on microplankton biomass from cell counts support this finding of substantial biomass in the central Scotia Sea; since these averaged half of values in the iron-fertilised bloom of the Georgia Basin downstream of South Georgia. Given that our transect was nearly 1000km long and in parts was land remote with low iron concentrations, the relatively high production in the central and northern Scotia Sea is surprising. Iron levels may be maintained here by efficient recycling and irregular injections, possibly for example from dust deposition or shelf-derived inputs from the south. The moderate chl-a concentration across the mid-Scotia Sea and southwest of South Georgia reflect periodic, non-ice-associated blooms that occur in some years and not others. These may provide a connection between the large populations of krill inhabiting the northern and southern fringes of the Scotia Sea.},

  abstract = {The Antarctic Circumpolar Current in Drake Passage comprises four regimes characterized by distinct temperature-salinity relationships in the near-surface waters and by different depths of common temperature-salinity characteristics in deeper water. Between the Subantarctic Zone in the northern passage and the Antarctic Zone farther south is a transition region, the Polar Frontal Zone. The southernmost regime is the Continental Zone, which is restricted to a narrow band near the southern continental slope. Historical hydrographic data are used to determine the mean positions of the fronts that separate the zones. Expandable bathythermograph data show that the Subantarctic and the Polar fronts fluctuate about 100 km north and south of their mean positions. No seasonal differences in the mean frontal positions are evident. Baroclinic geostrophic transport calculations relative to 2500 dbar were made from synoptic hydrographic station pairs that span the passage. For sections that encompass the Subantarctic and Continental zones, the mean summer transport is 78.7 \texttimes{} 106 m3 s-1, about 10\% higher than the winter mean of 70.6 \texttimes{} 106 m3 s-1. Transport calculations were also made from the average values of dynamic height and transport function within the Subantarctic and Continental Zones. The mean summer transport of 80.9 \texttimes{} 106 m3 s-1 is significantly different from the winter mean of 73.4 \texttimes{} 106 m3 s-1. The largest flow in summer is between the Subantarctic and Polar Frontal Zones, whereas in winter the flow between the Polar Frontal Zone and the Antarctic Zone is predominant. The lower winter transport is associated with shallower isopycnals throughout the water column in the Subantarctic Zone. Seasonal dynamic height averages are used to estimate the baroclinic component of the pressure signals from gauges deployed at each side of the passage between 1976 and 1978. The total transport (baroclinic plus barotropic) is estimated to be on the order of 26 \texttimes{} 106 m3 s-1 greater in winter than in summer.},

Early mechanism-based theory asserted that food webs have little omnivory and several properties that are independent of species richness1,2,3,4,6. This theory was overturned by empirical studies that found food webs to be much more complex5,7,8,9,14,15,16,17,18, but these studies did not provide mechanistic explanations for the complexity9. Here we show that a remarkably simple model fills this scientific void by successfully predicting key structural properties of the most complex and comprehensive food webs in the primary literature. These properties include the fractions of species at top, intermediate and basal trophic levels, the means and variabilities of generality, vulnerability and food-chain length, and the degrees of cannibalism, omnivory, looping and trophic similarity. Using only two empirical parameters, species number and connectance, our `niche model' extends the existing `cascade model'3,19 and improves its fit ten-fold by constraining species to consume a contiguous sequence of prey in a one-dimensional trophic niche20.},

Understanding how different aspects of sampling effort affect ecological network structure is important for both fundamental ecological knowledge and the application of network analysis in conservation and management. Using a highly resolved food web for the marine intertidal ecosystem of the Sanak Archipelago in the Eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska, we assess how commonly studied properties of network structure differ for 281 versions of the food web sampled at five levels of spatial scale representing six orders of magnitude in area spread across the archipelago. Species (S) and link (L) richness both increased by approximately one order of magnitude across the five spatial scales. Links per species (L/S) more than doubled, while connectance (C) decreased by approximately two-thirds. Fourteen commonly studied properties of network structure varied systematically with spatial scale of sampling, some increasing and others decreasing. While ecological network properties varied systematically with sampling extent, analyses using the niche model and a power-law scaling relationship indicate that for many properties, this apparent sensitivity is attributable to the increasing S and decreasing C of webs with increasing spatial scale. As long as effects of S and C are accounted for, areal sampling bias does not have a special impact on our understanding of many aspects of network structure. However, attention does need be paid to some properties such as the fraction of species in loops, which increases more than expected with greater spatial scales of sampling.},

  abstract = {IntroductionMesopelagic fishes play a central role in the transfer of energy through open-ocean food webs, particularly in the Southern Ocean where they are both important predators of zooplankton and a key prey group for many higher predators. However, they are notoriously difficult to sample, which has limited our understanding of the bio-physical predictors of their abundance and spatiotemporal variability. Species distribution models can be used to help understand species' ecological requirements by relating records of their presence or abundance to environmental data.MethodsHere, we used data from Myctobase \textendash{} a new circumpolar database of mesopelagic fishes \textendash{} to model patterns in abundance of eight key myctophid species (family Myctophidae) and the genus Bathylagus in the Southern Ocean south of 45\textdegree S. We developed species-specific boosted regression tree models to obtain circumpolar predictions of abundance. Average daytime and night-time summer predictions for the period 1997 to 2011 at 0 to 200m depths were generated for each species.ResultsDepth and solar position were important predictors and species were stratified in their depth distribution. For all species, except for G. nicholsi, there was an interaction between depth of capture and solar position, reflecting diel vertical migration. Other important variables included sea surface temperature, dissolved oxygen at 200 m, chlorophyll a, and sea surface height, indicating an association with water mass properties. Circumpolar patterns of abundance varied between species with some displaying affinities for oceanic regions at Antarctic latitudes (e.g., E. antarctica and Bathylagus spp.) or sub-Antarctic latitudes (e.g., K. anderssoni and P. tenisoni); and affinities for shelf regions (e.g., P. boliniand G. nicholsi).DiscussionOur findings suggest that the abundance of mesopelagic fish is influenced by diel vertical migration and meso- and sub-mesoscale oceanographic features, with the Polar Front being a major delimiting feature. Our study showed contrasting patterns in community composition with higher species diversity north of the Polar Front that might be indicative of latitudinal variability in food web structure. Our spatial analysis is an important step toward resolving what determines important habitat for mesopelagic fishes, providing foundational information for understanding shifting food web dynamics into the future.},

  abstract = {Summary Attempts to gauge the biological impacts of climate change have typically focussed on the lower levels of organization (individuals to populations), rather than considering more complex multi-species systems, such as entire ecological networks (food webs, mutualistic and host\textendash parasitoid networks). We evaluate the possibility that a few principal drivers underpin network-level responses to climate change, and that these drivers can be studied to develop a more coherent theoretical framework than is currently provided by phenomenological approaches. For instance, warming will elevate individual ectotherm metabolic rates, and direct and indirect effects of changes in atmospheric conditions are expected to alter the stoichiometry of interactions between primary consumers and basal resources; these effects are general and pervasive, and will permeate through the entire networks that they affect. In addition, changes in the density and viscosity of aqueous media could alter interactions among very small organisms and disrupt the pycnoclines that currently compartmentalize many aquatic networks in time and space. We identify a range of approaches and potential model systems that are particularly well suited to network-level studies within the context of climate change. We also highlight potentially fruitful areas of research with a view to improving our predictive power regarding climate change impacts on networks. We focus throughout on mechanistic approaches rooted in first principles that demonstrate potential for application across a wide range of taxa and systems.},

Past work, including many studies of marine food webs, has primarily documented the existence of indirect effects and how particular examples arise. Future challenges include (1) developing methods for the systematic detection of indirect effects, (2) documenting the functions describing different classes of interaction modifications, (3) exploring methods to predict indirect effects, including measurement of interaction strengths among species, (4) integrating time-scale differences into the theory of indirect effects, and (5) linking indirect effects and environmental variability.

  abstract = {Omnivory, feeding at more than one trophic level, is a prevalent feature of freshwater ecosystems. Understanding where and when omnivory is important, its relevance for sustaining diversity, and the effect it may have on ecosystem responses to disturbances, are necessary for effective management of freshwater ecosystems. The many theoretical predictions of the effects of omnivory are often contradictory, and empirical studies aimed at understanding omnivory have been difficult and contingent on a number of factors. Here, I synthesise theoretical evidence to generate five predictions of where omnivory will be most important in freshwater ecosystems, how it is maintained and the effect it will have on communities. First, theory indicates that, while strong omnivorous interactions are destabilising, weak omnivorous interactions usually enhance stability. Therefore, mechanisms which decrease the strength of omnivorous interactions should favour their occurrence and increase stability of food webs. Secondly, omnivorous interactions which are theoretically unstable may be found in stable food webs due to stabilising features of the web as a whole. Thirdly, omnivory is likely to persist primarily at intermediate productivity levels and be more common in disturbed environments. Fourthly, omnivory is likely to decrease the strength of trophic cascades. Finally, omnivores should generally make more successful invaders. These predictions are important for effective freshwater management because actions which decrease the strength of omnivorous interactions, such as maintaining habitat refuges for consumers (e.g. woody debris and aquatic plants), may be essential for sustaining biodiversity. In addition, if omnivores make better invaders, effective invasion management may benefit from focussing resources on omnivorous invaders to limit their spread and impact. Overall, this synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies indicates that, while their predictions may be frequently at odds, with deeper investigation they are largely reconcilable and can be used to make practical suggestions for the careful management of omnivory in freshwater food webs.},

When the sizes of direct interactions are determined to within an order of magnitude, the long\textemdash term outcomes of press pertubations are highly indeterminate, in terms both of whether species densities increase or decrease and of which interactions have the largest effects. It is emphasized that short\textemdash term observations of systems subject to press perturbations (e.g., toxin additions to ecosystems, or experimental manipulations of species using exclosures) are not useful for estimating long\textemdash term impacts. The difference between long\textemdash{} and short\textemdash term responses is detailed, and a rule of thumb is given for what constitutes 'long\textemdash term' in this context.},

  abstract = {As in many regions worldwide, seabird colonies in Argentina are important conservation targets of marine protected areas (MPAs). Seabirds are wide ranging, often crossing jurisdictional boundaries during foraging. Using a recently designated MPA as a case study, this article discusses the challenges of protecting breeding seabirds given their spatial requirements and use of different jurisdictions. Seabirds breeding at the MPA have distinct foraging strategies. Rock Shags and Olrog's Gulls forage inshore within the MPA. Imperial Cormorants, Magellanic Penguins, and Southern Giant Petrels, in contrast, often feed beyond the MPA's jurisdiction, traveling into provincial, federal, or international waters where they can be affected by fisheries and oil development. This indicates the need of management actions beyond MPA boundaries. The large scale and connectivity of marine ecosystems and the variety of economic pressures require the participation of stakeholders and several government agencies in conservation issues, and thus integrated coastal management and marine spatial planning appear as options to complement the use of MPAs. Although MPAs are a valuable tool to conserve breeding seabirds, increased efforts are needed to design new governance structures and complementary strategies for spatial protection so as to deal with the biological, social, and political complexities of marine systems.},

  abstract = {We quantified the trophic niche of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) breeding and moulting in Golfo San Jorge, Argentina, through conventional stomach content and stable isotope analysis. A total of 112 adults were flushed during the early and late chick stages of 2011 and 2012 at Isla Vernacci Norte, and at least 15 prey taxa were found, including fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans and polychaetes. Overall, Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) showed the highest contribution in terms of importance by mass (68.1\textendash 85.3\%, depending on chick stage and year), except for the old chick stage in 2011 when the shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) was the main prey consumed (56.0\%). Based on carbon and nitrogen isotopic values from a total of 256 blood samples, corresponding to young and old chicks and to adults of both sexes sampled throughout the incubation, chick and moult stages at the above mentioned colony and years, Bayesian mixing model outputs showed that Argentine anchovy was always the main prey (48\textendash 86\%). Bayesian mixing model outputs obtained from adults of both sexes and their chicks during the late chick stage of 2013 at Isla Vernacci Norte, Isla Tova and Isla Leones also showed that Argentine anchovy was the main prey consumed. This is the first comprehensive assessment of Magellanic penguin diet composition in northern Patagonia, quantifying the relative contribution of prey in the diet of adults and chicks at different stages of the annual cycle and years, and confirms the relevance of a forage fish such as the Argentine anchovy in its trophic ecology.},

  abstract = {Species extinctions are accelerating globally, yet the mechanisms that maintain local biodiversity remain poorly understood. The extinction of species that feed on or are fed on by many others (i.e. `hubs') has traditionally been thought to cause the greatest threat of further biodiversity loss. Very little attention has been paid to the strength of those feeding links (i.e. link weight) and the prevalence of indirect interactions. Here, we used a dynamical model based on empirical energy budget data to assess changes in ecosystem stability after simulating the loss of species according to various extinction scenarios. Link weight and/or indirect effects had stronger effects on food-web stability than the simple removal of `hubs', demonstrating that both quantitative fluxes and species dissipating their effects across many links should be of great concern in biodiversity conservation, and the potential for `hubs' to act as keystone species may have been exaggerated to date.},

  abstract = {Temperature and biodiversity changes occur in concert, but their joint effects on ecological stability of natural food webs are unknown. Here, we assess these relationships in 19 planktonic food webs. We estimate stability as structural stability (using the volume contraction rate) and temporal stability (using the temporal variation of species abundances). Warmer temperatures were associated with lower structural and temporal stability, while biodiversity had no consistent effects on either stability property. While species richness was associated with lower structural stability and higher temporal stability, Simpson diversity was associated with higher temporal stability. The responses of structural stability were linked to disproportionate contributions from two trophic groups (predators and consumers), while the responses of temporal stability were linked both to synchrony of all species within the food web and distinctive contributions from three trophic groups (predators, consumers, and producers). Our results suggest that, in natural ecosystems, warmer temperatures can erode ecosystem stability, while biodiversity changes may not have consistent effects.},

The Weddell Sea contributes nearly a half of global AABW through Weddell Sea Deep Water and denser underlying Weddell Sea Bottom Water that form on the continental shelves via sea-ice production. Here we report an observed 30\% reduction of Weddell Sea Bottom Water volume since 1992, with the largest decrease in the densest classes. This is probably driven by a multidecadal reduction in dense-water production over southern continental shelf associated with a {$>$}40\% decline in the sea-ice formation rate. The ice production decrease is driven by northerly wind trend, related to a phase transition of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation since the early 1990s, superposed by Amundsen Sea Low intrinsic variability. These results reveal key influences on exported AABW to the Atlantic abyss and their sensitivity to large-scale, multidecadal climate variability.},

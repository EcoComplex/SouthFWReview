## Abstract

1. Ecological networks are increasingly used as conceptual frameworks for understanding ecological community structure, identifying key species, and for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation.

2. Here we propose to review the response of trophic interaction networks, hereafter food webs, to multiple stressors in six marine ecosystems along a latitudinal gradient in the Southern Hemisphere: San Jorge Gulf (45-47°S, 65-68°W), Beagle Channel (54°S, 68°W), Burdwood Bank (54°S, 59°W), Scotia Sea (57°S, 50°W), Potter Cove (62°S, 58°W, Antarctica), and Weddell Sea (74-78°S, 30°W, Antarctica). The food webs for the chosen systems are highly resolved, meaning that the overwhelming majority of nodes are resolved to genus or species level. These locations include temperate to Antarctic ecosystems exposed to both anthropogenic (fisheries, pollution) and environmental (temperature increase) impacts.

3. Our primary objectives are to: 1) describe and compare the food webs in terms of network properties of complexity, structure, potential stability; 2) show how these properties could be impacted due to the ongoing anthropogenic and/or environmental stressors; 3) identify key species and its characteristics (i.e. trophic position) for the stability of the food web; and 4) give suggestions on which data and analyses are needed to gain insights into ecosystem functioning and perturbation response.

4. This review will show the advantages of applying a network approach to better understand marine ecosystems of the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, this paper will make progress towards gaining a comprehensive knowledge to predict the responses of complex marine systems to anthropogenic and environmental changes.

## The structure of marine food webs in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean

Describe the state-of-art for the six food webs considered in this study. Start with a brief description of the area.
San Jorge Gulf
Beagle Channel
Burdwood Bank
Potter Cove
Scotia Sea

* Weddell Sea: Located between 74 and 78ºS, the high Antarctic Weddell Sea shelf spans approximately 450 km from East to West (see Figure 1). The water depth in this area ranges from 200 to 500 meters, with shallower regions being covered by continental ice that forms the coastline along the eastern and southern parts of the Weddell Sea. Within this shelf area, there exists a complex three-dimensional benthic habitat characterized by substantial benthic biomasses and an intermediate to high diversity when compared to benthic boreal communities [@Dayton1990; @Teixido2002].

In this region there are several stressors already triggered by climate change, 1) ice shelf collapses, 2) increases in iceberg scouring, 3) reductions in sea ice spatial and temporal extent, 4) acidification and warming [@Isla2023; @Gutt2015]. Currently there are no krill fishery activities and exploratory fishing for Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) [@Teschke2021]. 

<!-- phytoplankton --> 

Primary production by phytoplankton is expected to increase in the short-term in response to increased light availability due to sea ice loss and ice shelf collapse [@Dinniman2023]. This can lead to increased phytoplankton biomass and organic matter flux to the seafloor, fueling benthic recolonization [@Sane2012]. However, community composition changes are likely, as warmer more stratified conditions favor small flagellates over diatoms, reducing energy transfer to higher trophic levels. Ocean acidification may counteract any productivity increases by negatively impacting key phytoplankton groups like foraminifera and flagellates [@Hancock2020], reducing carbon export [@Moy2009;@Deppeler2020]. While primary production may increase transiently [@Dinniman2023; @Lin2011], changes in community structure toward smaller cells, reduced carbon export, and altered energy transfer to higher trophic levels are more certain [@Mendes2018; @Pauli2021]. The net effect on phytoplankton biomass is unclear as some stressors like sea ice loss tend to increase production, while others like acidification tend to decrease it. However, ecological impacts through altered community structure and reduced carbon export to the benthos are likely.

<!-- Krill --> 
For instance, crucial habitats for krill recruitment may be severely impacted, leading to compromised hatching success [@Kawaguchi2013]

<!-- Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, have a high resilience to elevated CO 2 when exposed over an entire year. These and other studies suggest that some invertebrates may be able to adapt over time to ocean acidification conditions and produce more resilient offspring, but further long-term studies are needed to fully explore this intergenerational adaptive capacity (Peck, 2018). [@Hancock2020] -->

<!-- Multiple stressors: The Southern Ocean and nearshore Antarctic waters are also warming, sea-ice is predicted to decline, winds are strengthening, upwelling and nutrient availability is changing, mixed layer depths are shallowing, and the ocean fronts are moving southward (Deppeler & Davidson, 2017; Stark, Raymond, Deppeler, & Morrison, 2019). These stressors interact, resulting in additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects on organisms (Boyd, Brown, Schrum, & Krishnakumar, 2015).

## Abstract

1. Ecological networks are increasingly used as conceptual frameworks for understanding ecological community structure, identifying key species, and for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation.

2. Here we propose to review the response of trophic interaction networks, hereafter food webs, to multiple stressors in six marine ecosystems along a latitudinal gradient in the Southern Hemisphere: San Jorge Gulf (45-47°S, 65-68°W), Beagle Channel (54°S, 68°W), Burdwood Bank (54°S, 59°W), Scotia Sea (57°S, 50°W), Potter Cove (62°S, 58°W, Antarctica), and Weddell Sea (74-78°S, 30°W, Antarctica). The food webs for the chosen systems are highly resolved, meaning that the overwhelming majority of nodes are resolved to genus or species level. These locations include temperate to Antarctic ecosystems exposed to both anthropogenic (fisheries, pollution) and environmental (temperature increase) impacts.

3. Our primary objectives are to: 1) describe and compare the food webs in terms of network properties of complexity, structure, potential stability; 2) show how these properties could be impacted due to the ongoing anthropogenic and/or environmental stressors; 3) identify key species and its characteristics (i.e. trophic position) for the stability of the food web; and 4) give suggestions on which data and analyses are needed to gain insights into ecosystem functioning and perturbation response.

4. This review will show the advantages of applying a network approach to better understand marine ecosystems of the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, this paper will make progress towards gaining a comprehensive knowledge to predict the responses of complex marine systems to anthropogenic and environmental changes.

## The structure of marine food webs in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean

Describe the state-of-art for the six food webs considered in this study. Start with a brief description of the area.
* San Jorge Gulf

* Beagle Channel

* Burdwood Bank

The MPAs Namuncurá - Burdwood Bank I and II, created by National Laws 26.875 in 2013 and 27.490 in 2017, comprise a shallow submarine plateau called Burdwood Bank (BB) and a deep slope that reaches 4000 m in depth, N-BB I and N-BB II, respectively [@AdministraciondeParquesNacionales2022; @Tombesi2020] (Figure 1). The MPA N-BB I comprises nearly 28,900 km2 circumscribed by the 200 m isobath, between ~54º–55ºS and ~56º–62ºW, with a slight slope extended nearly 370 km east–west. Physical features in the BB are fairly stable, with salinity averaging 34 all year round and temperature ranging between 4 and 8ºC [@Acha2004; @Piola2009]. The BB is surrounded by steep flanks of up to 4000 m depth, which are protectd by the MPA N-BB II (32,000 km2; ~55º-56ºS, ~58º-62ºW). Intense upwelling and mixing occur in relation with the slope, entraining deep nutrient-rich waters into the photic layer [@Piola2009; @Matano2019] and resulting in a fairly homogeneous water column both spatially and temporally [@Glorioso1995; @Matano2019].

* Potter Cove

* Scotia Sea

* Weddell Sea

Located between 74 and 78ºS, the high Antarctic Weddell Sea shelf spans approximately 450 km from East to West (Figure 1). The water depth in this area ranges from 200 to 500 meters, with shallower regions being covered by continental ice that forms the coastline along the eastern and southern parts of the Weddell Sea. Within this shelf area, there exists a complex three-dimensional benthic habitat characterized by substantial benthic biomasses and an intermediate to high diversity when compared to benthic boreal communities [@Dayton1990; @Teixido2002].

Anthropogenic contaminants such as microplastics  and mercury are present in the water column of the MPAs Namuncurá - Burdwood Bank I and II (MPA N-BB) (Cossi et al., 2021; Di Mauro et al., 2022; Fioramonti et al., 2022). Also, fishing vessels are allowed to operate in the western section of the MPA N-BB (i.e. Marine National Reserve category), altering the stocks of commercially important fish species (Administración de Parques Nacionales, 2022; Martínez et al., 2021). Moreover, there is a potential hazard related to the effects of offshore hydrocarbon activities (exploration and exploitation) to the west of the MPA N-BB (Administración de Parques Nacionales, 2022).

Microplastics are distributed all along the water column, from surface to deep waters (3-2450 m) in the ecosystem (Di Mauro et al., 2022). More importantly, microplastics were found in soft tissues of benthic macro invertebrates (sea stars Henricia obesa and Odontaster penicillatus) and benthopelagic fishes (Patagonotothen guntheri and P. ramsayi), which not only incorporated the contaminant from the environment through their filter-feeding system but could also get it indirectly from prey organisms already containing plastics in their tissues (Cossi et al. 2021, Pérez et al. 2021). Notably, one of the contaminated species, the long tail southern cod Patagonotothen ramsayi, is part of the core group of species that drive the ecosystem through a wasp-waist control (Riccialdelli et al. 2020).

Mercury transfer and biomagnification are ongoing processes in the ecosystem, which are occurring at a greater pace than near coastal areas (Beagle Channel) (Fioramonti et al., 2022). It’s important to note that the Patagonian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), a pelagic fish with a mid-trophic level in the food web, presented the highest levels of mercury (Fioramonti et al., 2022). Considering the mentioned wasp-waist control of the ecosystem, in which the Patagonian sprat plays a key role (Riccialdelli et al. 2020), a rapid and wide spread of the contaminant to the top predators of the food web is expected (Fioramonti et al., 2022).

Several fisheries targeting demersal fishes operate in the vicinity and within the ecosystem of the MPA N-BB (i.e. Marine National Reserve management category). The Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus) and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) ones have gained prominence in recent years (Gorini et al. 2015; Martínez et al. 2015; Allega et al. 2020; references in Administración de Parques Nacionales, 2022). Although these are regulated by the Argentinean government, incidental catches do occur, where demersal fishes of the genera Coelorinchus and Macrourus, and benthic invertebrates (88 taxa) are the most common bycatches (Gaitán & Marí, 2016; Martínez et al. 2022). Noteworthy, among the invertebrates caught, 8 species are indicator taxa of vulnerable marine ecosystems (Gaitán & Marí, 2016; Schejter and Albano, 2021). Independent assessments of these bycatches suggest no significant impact on the communities (Gaitán & Marí, 2016; Martínez et al. 2022). Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge considering the species’ role in the ecosystem and the potential joint effect of both target fishes and bycatch in a broader framework (food web).

In recent years, licenses for seismic studies and exploration of hydrocarbon resources have been granted all along the northwestern limit of the MPA N-BB (Secretaría de Gobierno de Energía Res. Nº 65/2018). Although the effects of these type of surveys on marine mammals and seabirds are well-known worldwide (e.g. Nowacek et al. 2015), there is no particular knowledge for the MPA N-BB ecosystem. However, several documents warn on the potential effects on the species inhabiting the MPA N-BB (Allega et al. 2020; de Haro et al. 2022).

In this region there are several stressors already triggered by climate change, 1) ice shelf collapses, 2) increases in iceberg scouring, 3) reductions in sea ice spatial and temporal extent, 4) acidification and warming [@Isla2023; @Gutt2015]. Currently there are no krill fishery activities and exploratory fishing for Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) [@Teschke2021]. 

<!-- phytoplankton --> 

Primary production by phytoplankton is expected to increase in the short-term in response to increased light availability due to sea ice loss and ice shelf collapse [@Dinniman2023]. This can lead to increased phytoplankton biomass and organic matter flux to the seafloor, fueling benthic recolonization [@Sane2012]. However, community composition changes are likely, as warmer more stratified conditions favor small flagellates over diatoms, reducing energy transfer to higher trophic levels. Ocean acidification may counteract any productivity increases by negatively impacting key phytoplankton groups like foraminifera and flagellates [@Hancock2020], reducing carbon export [@Moy2009;@Deppeler2020]. While primary production may increase transiently [@Dinniman2023; @Lin2011], changes in community structure toward smaller cells, reduced carbon export, and altered energy transfer to higher trophic levels are more certain [@Mendes2018; @Pauli2021]. The net effect on phytoplankton biomass is unclear as some stressors like sea ice loss tend to increase production, while others like acidification tend to decrease it. However, ecological impacts through altered community structure and reduced carbon export to the benthos are likely.

<!-- Krill --> 
It has been suggested that the krill (Euphausia superba) population in the South Atlantic has already declined as a result of productivity changes caused by the decline in sea ice [@Atkinson2004]. Declining sea ice cover further allows increased access to krill by predators [@Kawaguchi2009]. Some studies suggest that crucial habitats for krill  recruitment may be severely impacted by ocean acidification, with reductions of up to 60–70% in the Weddell Sea [@Kawaguchi2013]. Beside, some studies suggest that krill has a high resilience to elevated CO2 when exposed over an entire year [@Hancock2020], but multiple stressors are suggested to have synergistic effects on krill populations [@Kawaguchi2013].

Declining krill abundances could lead to decreased carbon flux, because its fecal pellets account for the majority of exported carbon [@Pauli2021]. This adds to the previously mentioned effect of phytoplankton on the carbon flux, thus the impact on benthos will likely be important.

<!-- Benthos -->

The current warming at the sea surface coincides with an ongoing warming of the water column concentrated within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current at depths ranging from 700 m to 1100 m [@Gille2002]. This observed warming trend resulted in an increase of nearly 0.2°C between 1950 and 1980, which is faster than the average warming rate of the global ocean and comparable to the atmospheric warming in the Southern Ocean. Similar warming patterns were also observed in the deep water column of the Weddell Sea during the 1970s to 1990s [@Robertson2002]. These temperature changes have significant implications for macrobenthic communities that thrive on the continental shelf. These communities are particularly vulnerable because their animal components are mostly sessile and have adapted to cold (<0°C) and stable environmental conditions [@Isla2023]. Due to their location at the southern border of the Southern Ocean, these communities are unable to escape or migrate to colder environments. Their survival depends on their limited genetic plasticity to cope with environmental stress until sufficient genetic adaptations can be achieved [@Peck2018].


<!-- Multiple stressors: The Southern Ocean and nearshore Antarctic waters are also warming, sea-ice is predicted to decline, winds are strengthening, upwelling and nutrient availability is changing, mixed layer depths are shallowing, and the ocean fronts are moving southward (Deppeler & Davidson, 2017; Stark, Raymond, Deppeler, & Morrison, 2019). These stressors interact, resulting in additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects on organisms (Boyd, Brown, Schrum, & Krishnakumar, 2015).

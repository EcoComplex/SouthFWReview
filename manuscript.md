## Abstract

1. Ecological networks are increasingly used as conceptual frameworks for understanding ecological community structure, identifying key species, and for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation.

2. Here we propose to review the response of trophic interaction networks, hereafter food webs, to multiple stressors in six marine ecosystems along a latitudinal gradient in the Southern Hemisphere: San Jorge Gulf (45-47°S, 65-68°W), Beagle Channel (54°S, 68°W), Burdwood Bank (54°S, 59°W), Scotia Sea (57°S, 50°W), Potter Cove (62°S, 58°W, Antarctica), and Weddell Sea (74-78°S, 30°W, Antarctica). The food webs for the chosen systems are highly resolved, meaning that the overwhelming majority of nodes are resolved to genus or species level. These locations include temperate to Antarctic ecosystems exposed to both anthropogenic (fisheries, pollution) and environmental (temperature increase) impacts.

3. Our primary objectives are to: 1) describe and compare the food webs in terms of network properties of complexity, structure, potential stability; 2) show how these properties could be impacted due to the ongoing anthropogenic and/or environmental stressors; 3) identify key species and its characteristics (i.e. trophic position) for the stability of the food web; and 4) give suggestions on which data and analyses are needed to gain insights into ecosystem functioning and perturbation response.

4. This review will show the advantages of applying a network approach to better understand marine ecosystems of the Southern Hemisphere. Overall, this paper will make progress towards gaining a comprehensive knowledge to predict the responses of complex marine systems to anthropogenic and environmental changes.

## Introduction

Ecological networks are increasingly used as conceptual frameworks for understanding ecological community structure, identifying key species, and for ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation [@Thompson2012]. Recently, there has been an upsurge in interest regarding how communities might respond to environmental and anthropogenic changes, applying a network approach [@Montoya2009; @Tylianakis2017]. This is particularly crucial in marine ecosystems where changes are of unprecedented magnitudes [@Gutt2015; @Turner2020; @Galvan2022].
In this review, we focus on the actual and potential changes in prey-predator networks, hereafter food webs, driven by reported stressors in selected marine ecosystems along a latitudinal gradient in the Southern Hemisphere (45 - 78ºS). We only considered those cases where highly-resolved food webs, describing the ecosystem’s diversity of species and trophic interactions, were published. Then, we included the following ecosystems: San Jorge Gulf (45 - 47ºS, 65-68ºW), Beagle Channel (~54ºS, 68ºW), Burdwood Bank (~54ºS, 59ºW), Scotia Sea (48 - 58ºS, 50ºW), Potter Cove (62ºS, 58ºW, Antarctica), and Weddell Sea (74 - 78ºS, 30ºW, Antarctica). These locations include temperate to Antarctic ecosystems exposed to both environmental (sea warming, glacial retreat) and anthropogenic (fishery, pollution) stressors.
The aim of this review is threefold: 1) describe the complexity and structure of the above-mentioned marine food webs from a network perspective; 2) identify the ongoing environmental and anthropogenic stressors for each marine ecosystem containing the food webs; and 3) elaborate hypotheses on how the identified stressors might affect food web features (e.g. energy flow, stability), combining information on node- and network-level properties. Finally, we give suggestions on which data and analyses are needed to gain insights into the stressors’ effects on food web properties in the southwest Atlantic - Antarctic region.


## The structure of marine food webs in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean

Together the southwest and the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean comprise one of the most biologically productive regions of the world ocean [@Acha2004; @Whitehouse2008; @Ballerini2014; @Latorre2023]. The referred region extends from San Jorge Gulf (45ºS) in the Patagonian shelf to the Weddell Sea (78ºS) in the Southern Ocean, and covers a well-connected oceanic latitudinal gradient [@Matano2010; @Steele2010].
Throughout this latitudinal gradient, many investigations have been carried out addressing the trophic ecology of focal species or particular prey-predator relationships of interest [@Vinuesa2007; @Sailley2013; @Pasotti2015; @Riccialdelli2017; @Riccialdelli2020; @Saunders2019]. In this context, few works have considered the complexity of the ecosystem in terms of species and prey-predator interactions [@Jacob2011; @Marina2018; @Funes2022; @Lopez-Lopez2022; @Rodriguez2022; @Marina2023]. Neglecting this complexity might lead to a misunderstanding of the structure and functioning of the food web, and ultimately reduce the ability to predict ecosystem responses to perturbations [@Montoya2009; @Woodward2010].
In the last decades, the application of a network perspective has emerged as a powerful tool to tackle the complexity of ecosystems facilitating a better understanding of the structure and functioning of empirical marine food webs [@Belgrano2005; @Thompson2012; @DAlelio2016]. Few studies of this type cover a latitudinal gradient in marine ecosystems, with some cases for  the Global North [@Kortsch2019; @Frelat2022; @Pecuchet2022], but none for the Global South or Southern Hemisphere. In this section, we review for the first time the state-of-the-art structure of complex marine food webs in a Southwest Atlantic - Antarctic latitudinal gradient, considering the following marine ecosystems: San Jorge Gulf (45 - 47ºS), Burdwood Bank (~ 54ºS), Beagle Channel (54ºS), Scotia Sea (48 - 58ºS), Potter Cove (62ºS, Antarctica) and Weddell Sea (74 - 78ºS, Antarctica) (Figure 1).

Located between 74 and 78ºS, the high Antarctic Weddell Sea shelf spans approximately 450 km from East to West [@Jacob2011]. The water depth in this area ranges from 200 to 500 meters, with shallower regions being covered by continental ice that forms the coastline along the eastern and southern parts of the Weddell Sea. Within this shelf area, there exists a complex three-dimensional benthic habitat characterized by substantial benthic biomasses and an intermediate to high diversity when compared to benthic boreal communities [@Dayton1990; @Teixido2002]. The Weddell Sea food web exhibits a high level of network complexity, featuring the greatest number of trophic species and predator-prey interactions among the analyzed food webs. Its connectivity and other topological metrics are intermediate, as shown in Table 1. Recently, the interaction strengths of this food web were estimated, revealing the presence of numerous weak and few strong interactions, which is consistent with findings in other complex food webs. Notably, this asymmetric distribution of interaction strength is likely to promote community persistence. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that species with more food web linkages (i.e., higher degree) tend to have higher interaction strength, thus reinforcing their central role [@Marina2023]

### Burdwood Bank
Anthropogenic contaminants such as microplastics  and mercury are present in the water column of the MPAs Namuncurá - Burdwood Bank I and II (MPA N-BB) (Cossi et al., 2021; Di Mauro et al., 2022; Fioramonti et al., 2022). Also, fishing vessels are allowed to operate in the western section of the MPA N-BB (i.e. Marine National Reserve category), altering the stocks of commercially important fish species (Administración de Parques Nacionales, 2022; Martínez et al., 2021). Moreover, there is a potential hazard related to the effects of offshore hydrocarbon activities (exploration and exploitation) to the west of the MPA N-BB (Administración de Parques Nacionales, 2022).

Microplastics are distributed all along the water column, from surface to deep waters (3-2450 m) in the ecosystem (Di Mauro et al., 2022). More importantly, microplastics were found in soft tissues of benthic macro invertebrates (sea stars Henricia obesa and Odontaster penicillatus) and benthopelagic fishes (Patagonotothen guntheri and P. ramsayi), which not only incorporated the contaminant from the environment through their filter-feeding system but could also get it indirectly from prey organisms already containing plastics in their tissues (Cossi et al. 2021, Pérez et al. 2021). Notably, one of the contaminated species, the long tail southern cod Patagonotothen ramsayi, is part of the core group of species that drive the ecosystem through a wasp-waist control (Riccialdelli et al. 2020).

Mercury transfer and biomagnification are ongoing processes in the ecosystem, which are occurring at a greater pace than near coastal areas (Beagle Channel) (Fioramonti et al., 2022). It’s important to note that the Patagonian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), a pelagic fish with a mid-trophic level in the food web, presented the highest levels of mercury (Fioramonti et al., 2022). Considering the mentioned wasp-waist control of the ecosystem, in which the Patagonian sprat plays a key role (Riccialdelli et al. 2020), a rapid and wide spread of the contaminant to the top predators of the food web is expected (Fioramonti et al., 2022).

Several fisheries targeting demersal fishes operate in the vicinity and within the ecosystem of the MPA N-BB (i.e. Marine National Reserve management category). The Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus) and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) ones have gained prominence in recent years (Gorini et al. 2015; Martínez et al. 2015; Allega et al. 2020; references in Administración de Parques Nacionales, 2022). Although these are regulated by the Argentinean government, incidental catches do occur, where demersal fishes of the genera Coelorinchus and Macrourus, and benthic invertebrates (88 taxa) are the most common bycatches (Gaitán & Marí, 2016; Martínez et al. 2022). Noteworthy, among the invertebrates caught, 8 species are indicator taxa of vulnerable marine ecosystems (Gaitán & Marí, 2016; Schejter and Albano, 2021). Independent assessments of these bycatches suggest no significant impact on the communities (Gaitán & Marí, 2016; Martínez et al. 2022). Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge considering the species’ role in the ecosystem and the potential joint effect of both target fishes and bycatch in a broader framework (food web).

In recent years, licenses for seismic studies and exploration of hydrocarbon resources have been granted all along the northwestern limit of the MPA N-BB (Secretaría de Gobierno de Energía Res. Nº 65/2018). Although the effects of these type of surveys on marine mammals and seabirds are well-known worldwide (e.g. Nowacek et al. 2015), there is no particular knowledge for the MPA N-BB ecosystem. However, several documents warn on the potential effects on the species inhabiting the MPA N-BB (Allega et al. 2020; de Haro et al. 2022).

Environmental stressors:

### Weddell Sea (Antarctica)

In this region there are several stressors already triggered by climate change, one of which is the persistent reductions in sea ice spatial and temporal extent since 2015, mainly in summer months. Sea ice extent has reached near record low levels during this period since the satellite era began in late 1978. Sea surface temperatures (SST) have also increased substantially, with the mean February 2017 SST for the whole Weddell Sea reaching 1.45°C, which was the highest monthly mean SST in the record and 0.56°C above the climatological mean [@Turner2020]. This warming trend at the sea surface coincides with other climate change impacts discussed here.

It has been suggested that the krill (Euphausia superba) population in the South Atlantic has already declined as a result of productivity changes caused by the decline in sea ice [@Atkinson2004]. Declining sea ice cover further allows increased access to krill by predators [@Kawaguchi2009], which could contribute to decreased krill abundances. Decreased krill abundances have the potential to result in reduced carbon flux due to the significant contribution of krill fecal pellets to exported carbon [@Pauli2021]. 

The impacts of climate change in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean are not uniform, and different species with varying life-history characteristics are expected to respond differently to the changing ecosystems. Studies have indicated that Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) and crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) exhibit varying levels of sensitivity to climate change. Crabeater seals, which exhibit a preference for breeding in close proximity to krill, are particularly susceptible to changes in sea ice concentrations, sea surface temperatures, and the availability of stable breeding ice. These factors can significantly affect their post-breeding foraging success and, ultimately, their future breeding success [@Wege2021; @Siniff2008].

In the case of birds, Thalassoica antarctica (Antarctic petrel), the numerically dominant species making up over 40% of individuals recorded. As a sea ice dependent forager and breeder, loss of this habitat will degrade its foraging success and reproductive output over time. Pagodroma nivea (snow petrel) also relies heavily on sea ice for foraging and its colonies near the study area may be affected. The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) uses sea ice for breeding and any reductions could constrain its populations. Sterna paradisaea (Arctic tern) spends summer in the Antarctic exploiting krill swarms under receding ice edges, so declines in ice cover may reduce prey availability and quality of molting habitats. Continued warming is thus expected to gradually erode the abundance and distribution of these 'primary species' that dominate the avifauna of the Weddell Sea through loss of critical sea ice habitat [@Orgeira2021].

Variations in Antarctic sea ice extent driven by climate change have implications for humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) populations through impacts on their primary prey resource of krill [@Braithwaite2015]. Decreased winter ice coverage results in reduced suitable habitat and lower krill abundance [@Braithwaite2015], with flow-on effects for whale body condition observed historically in harvest data. More recently in the rapidly warming Western Antarctic Peninsula, declining seasonal ice extent has corresponded to decreases in both krill stocks and humpback whale pregnancy rates that positively correlated with prior prey availability and ice conditions [@Pallin2023]. With climate projections indicating ongoing sea ice losses, further threats to critical krill populations pose risks to the energy intake and reproductive success and long-term viability of humpback whale populations dependent on consistent Antarctic feeding [@Pallin2023].

<!-- Ice shelf collapses -->
Primary production by phytoplankton is expected to increase in the short-term in response to increased light availability due to sea ice loss and ice shelf collapse [@Dinniman2023; @Pineda-metz2020]. Furthermore, in a warmer and more stable water column with a shallow upper mixed layer, the dominance of cryptophytes over diatoms may favor salp populations over krill populations, thereby also reducing the magnitude of energy transfer to upper trophic levels and the seabed [@Isla2023]. These findings further highlight the influence of phytoplankton dynamics on carbon flux and suggest a consequential impact on benthic ecosystems [@Constable2014].


<!-- Iceberg scouring increases -->
One of the key factors that contributes to the high biodiversity in benthic communities is the devastation caused by iceberg scouring, which is considered one of the most significant disturbances affecting large ecosystems [@Gutt2001]. Iceberg scouring has a profound impact on the benthic environment, even at depths of 600 m, as it violently disturbs the upper layers (several meters) of the seabed. This process completely removes the benthic macrofauna from the seafloor, creating a patchy disturbance and distribution pattern that occurs approximately once every 200 square meters over the Antarctic continental shelf [@Gutt1996; @Gutt2001a]. Predicted global warming is expected to increase the frequency of iceberg groundings [@Smale2008a], leading to substantial disruption of this environment [@Gutt1996; @Smale2008]. Given all this effects and the lack of information @Gutt2015 expects that tipping points could to play an important role.

<!-- Ocean warming -->

The current warming at the sea surface coincides with an ongoing warming of the water column concentrated within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current at depths ranging from 700 m to 1100 m [@Gille2002]. This observed warming trend resulted in an increase of nearly 0.2°C between 1950 and 1980, which is faster than the average warming rate of the global ocean and comparable to the atmospheric warming in the Southern Ocean. Similar warming patterns were also observed in the deep water column of the Weddell Sea during the 1970s to 1990s [@Robertson2002]. These temperature changes have significant implications for macrobenthic communities that thrive on the continental shelf. These communities are particularly vulnerable because their animal components are mostly sessile and have adapted to cold (<0°C) and stable environmental conditions [@Isla2023]. Due to their location at the southern border of the Southern Ocean, these communities are unable to escape or migrate to colder environments. Their survival depends on their limited genetic plasticity to cope with environmental stress until sufficient genetic adaptations can be achieved [@Peck2018; @Pineda-Metz2020].

Notothenioid fishes in the Weddell Sea region (Pleuragramma antarcticum) face multiple stressors that threaten their survival and ecological interactions. Rising water temperatures, particularly when combined with ocean acidification and habitat loss due to reductions in sea ice extent, pose a major threat to their persistence. While some species exhibit physiological plasticity to compensate for increased oxygen demand, most notothenioid fishes are stenothermal and unable to adjust their metabolic functioning [@Mintenbeck2012].

Toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni, D. eleginoides) recruitment is influenced by environmental relationships, indicating their potential vulnerability to changes in their habitat. These factors play a crucial role in shaping the response of toothfish species to environmental shifts. It is anticipated that the thermal habitat preferred by D. mawsoni could undergo contraction in the coming three decades [@Constable2014], further emphasizing the potential impact of a changing environment on these species.

<!-- Ocean acidification -->

Ocean acidification may counteract any productivity increases by negatively impacting key phytoplankton groups like foraminifera and flagellates, reducing carbon export [@Hancock2020; @Moy2009;@Deppeler2020]. Some studies suggest that crucial habitats for krill recruitment may be severely impacted by ocean acidification, with reductions of up to 60–70% in the Weddell Sea, while other studies suggest krill have a high resilience to elevated CO2 when exposed over an entire year; however, multiple stressors are suggested to have synergistic effects on krill populations [@Hancock2020; @Kawaguchi2013].


The works that describe the possible effects of stressors in this food web are few @Woodward2010 hypothetize that rising temperatures and shifts in warm and cold waters as ice sheets melt could lead to the colonization of new apex predators, such as shark species, which could exert top-down effects on the resident fauna in the food web. These invasions of new predators could potentially cause extensive rewiring of the network and result in cascading effects, including possible extinctions.




<!-- Multiple stressors: The Southern Ocean and nearshore Antarctic waters are also warming, sea-ice is predicted to decline, winds are strengthening, upwelling and nutrient availability is changing, mixed layer depths are shallowing, and the ocean fronts are moving southward (Deppeler & Davidson, 2017; Stark, Raymond, Deppeler, & Morrison, 2019). These stressors interact, resulting in additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects on organisms (Boyd, Brown, Schrum, & Krishnakumar, 2015).
[@Hancock2020] 

Climate change is likely to cause early breakout of seasonal sea ice in parts of Antarctica, which will dramatically increase the amount of light reaching shallow seabed. This is predicted to result in ecological regime shifts, in which invertebrate-dominated communities are replaced by macroalgal beds [@Clark2015].-->


## From species’ stressors to food web effects

The propagation of stressor-induced perturbations across food webs is significantly influenced by species interactions and cascading effects. One way to consider which are the species that more sensitive to these perturbations is the degree, which quantifies the number of connections a species has, provides a robust prediction of species importance and correlates with other indices that include indirect interactions [@Jordan2006]. There are various definitions for keystone species, and network position alone may not be the sole determinant. Considering abundance or biomass is also crucial as suggested by simulation studies [@Zhang2016b].

The impacts of stressors can vary in direction and magnitude as they move through the food web, due to differences in timescales and interacting species [@Jackson2021]. One approach to measure the effects of changes in species populations on the remaining species in a food web is the method of the inverse Jacobian matrix, which requires the knowledge of interaction strengths [@Montoya2009]. Using this approach it was found that the magnitude of net effects is negatively correlated with the  degree (sum of predator and prey links) of the perturbed species in most analyzed food webs. Species with few connections have stronger net effects on other species within food webs compared to highly connected species. Highly connected species may possess compensatory mechanisms, such as enhanced apparent competition, that regulate their biomass and mitigate the impacts of disturbances [@Montoya2009]. Similarly, studies by [@Zhao2016] have shown that the extinction of highly connected species in food webs, which have many feeding interactions, may not necessarily pose the greatest threat to biodiversity loss. Instead, the strength of feeding links and the prevalence of indirect interactions have a stronger influence on food web stability. Both quantitative fluxes and species dispersing their effects across many links are important considerations in biodiversity conservation. The potential for highly connected species to act as keystone species may have been overestimated in previous studies.

Recent studies suggest that significant apex predators [@Woodward2010; @OGorman2009] and marine mammals would exhibit high susceptibility to stressors and an inclination toward experiencing synergistic impacts . This susceptibility was largely attributed to their role in food chains as primary predators, as well as their involvement in omnivory and exploitative competition interactions. Predators species were predicted to either benefit synergistically from stressor effects by occupying trophic positions as mesopredators in omnivory interactions, or to display insensitivity to stressors due to their trophic role as resources in exploitative competition interactions [@Beauchesne2021], this suggest that the trophic level of a species could be important to anticipate the impact of stressors.

But also the species' vulnerability to stressor effects might arise solely from indirect exposure. The number of stressors influencing a species does not necessarily correlate with higher sensitivity. For instance @Beauchesne2021 showed that despite stressors impacting shrimp in terms of mortality, physiology, and behavior, its trophic sensitivity was low. On the other hand, marine mammals and seabirds that were not directly affected by stressors were markedly susceptible to the indirect repercussions of stressors and nonadditive effects.
